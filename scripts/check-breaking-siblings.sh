# scripts/check-breaking-siblings.sh — a release step: read the `*Breaks:*`
# tokens off a CHANGELOG section and grep the sibling checkouts for each, so a
# release's Breaking entries are read once with the question "who does this
# break?" put to every one of them.
#
# The engine ships beside siblings that consume it — the reader plugin, the
# field harness, the store adapters — and a Breaking entry is a sentence
# addressed to a reader, which nothing verifies. The 0.5.0 release renamed an
# `open-kb` option and broke `vaelii-foreign`'s test scaffolding and a
# downstream harness's benchmark cells; both were found by hand, afterwards.
#
# The asymmetry is the argument for grepping wide. An entry that names a sibling
# it does not break costs a maintainer one grep; an entry that names nobody
# ships a green release and a red sibling, found by whoever pulls next.
#
# ## The hook it reads
#
# Every Breaking entry carries one line beside its `*Class:*` (CONTRIBUTING
# §3.8), holding one backticked token per name a caller would have written:
#
#   *Breaks:* `:record-space`, `:index-space`
#
# A token is a retired option key or symbol, an ex-info `:type`, a fragment of a
# message somebody matches on, or the API name whose behaviour moves. More
# tokens than fit on one line take a second `*Breaks:*` line in the same entry —
# each line is read on its own, and nothing is carried across the wrap.
#
# ## What it finds, and what it does not
#
# **It greps text.** It finds a renamed option key, a matched message fragment
# and a named symbol. It does not find a behavioural change a sibling depends on
# without naming: a caller that counts a justification's antecedents, or one that
# relies on two facts merging, writes no token this can look for. So **absence of
# hits is not proof** — it says no sibling spells the name, not that no sibling
# breaks. A hit is likewise a place to look and not a verdict: the sibling may
# have moved already, or use the name for something of its own.
#
# The scan is per sibling checkout and covers its **tracked** files (`git grep`),
# which is what keeps a build tree and a gitignored 471 GB bench corpus out of
# the report. A directory that is not a git checkout — an unpacked release, say —
# is grepped directly, minus the build and scratch directories.
#
# ## Not a gate
#
# This is a release step, not a check the suite runs: it reads other repositories
# on the machine, and which of them are cloned is not a fact about this tree. A
# missing sibling is reported by name and costs nothing. It exits 0 whatever it
# finds; `--strict` is the one exception, and it fails on three things, all of
# them an entry saying less than §3.8 asks: a Breaking or Refusal entry naming no
# token at all — an entry nothing can check — one carrying no `*Migration:*` line,
# and one whose stated class is not among the three §3.8 defines. That last is
# the fail-open case and the reason the other two are checked here: the class is
# what decides the release number, and everything downstream reads a word it does
# not recognise as Additive.

# The siblings that consume the engine's API, named one by one rather than
# globbed off the parent directory — the same reason scripts/lint.sh names its
# scripts. A directory beside this checkout is not evidence of a consumer (an
# archived port, a scratch clone and this repo's own release staging all live
# there), and a roster is the place the judgement gets written down.
#
# The shipped roster is the published consumer alone. **Your own downstreams go
# in `.sibling-repos`**, one directory name per line, `#` comments allowed —
# untracked, because a roster is a fact about one machine's checkouts and a
# repository that published one would be advertising every private consumer it
# has by name.
#
# A file rather than an environment variable, deliberately: a `VAELII_*` name is
# part of the configuration surface (CONTRIBUTING §3.8) and owes a golden entry,
# a row in docs/operations.md and a changelog line, which is a lot of ceremony
# for a roster only a release step reads. `--root` already covers the one-off.
#
# What belongs on it is anything that goes through a door this repo can break:
# a plugin reaching into `vaelii.impl.*` on purpose, a store or feed adapter
# implementing the protocols, a harness driving the whole API — and content
# repositories too, since a newly refused sentence shape breaks a corpus that
# asserts it exactly like it breaks a caller.
