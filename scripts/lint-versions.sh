#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/lint-versions.sh — the version strings this tree states more than once
# must agree.
#
# `defproject`'s version is written in three places and lein-cloverage's in two,
# each with a "keep in sync" comment and nothing enforcing it.  A comment is not
# a check: these drift, and each drift reads as something other than what it is.
#
#   1. The README's install coordinate.  It is the same version string a second
#      time.  Do not treat it as lagging — "it should name the last *release*" is
#      the wrong model: `build-release-tree.sh` strips `-SNAPSHOT` **tree-wide**
#      and guards that none survives, so a dev README saying `0.5.0`
#      carves into a release README saying `0.5.0`, which is exactly right and
#      needs nobody to remember it.  A README pinned to a bare previous release
#      is the one that carves wrong: it survives the strip untouched and ships a
#      0.5.0 tree advertising 0.4.0, which is the single line a reader copies.
#      So the dev tree says snapshot everywhere and the cut says the release
#      everywhere.
#
#   2. lein-cloverage.  `scripts/coverage.sh` injects the plugin at the root
#      level because a :dev-profile plugin does not register the `cloverage`
#      task through `with-profile +test`; project.clj declares the same plugin
#      for editor tooling.  Two versions means the report and the declaration
#      describe different runs.
#
#   3. The release badge.  `.github/badges/release.svg` is *generated* from
#      `defproject` by `scripts/update-badges.sh`, and being generated is what
#      makes it drift: bumping the version does not run that script, and the
#      badge is a picture at the top of the README — a reader has no way to
#      tell `v0.5.0` painted there apart from the version the tree
#      actually builds.  Held to `agrees` rather than to equality, for the
#      reason the README coordinate is: on `develop` the badge names the release
#      that shipped, and the drift being looked for leaves a *snapshot* behind.
#
# Exit 0 when every pair agrees; prints each disagreement and the fix, and
# exits 1.

# agrees <own> <other> — is `other` a legal spelling beside this tree's `own`?
#
# Two shapes are legal, because three trees carry this file and they are not the
# same tree.  The dev tree and the cut tree are internally uniform: everything is
# `X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT`, or the carve has stripped every suffix and everything is
# `X.Y.Z`.  **`develop` is deliberately not uniform.** `bump-develop.sh` rewrites
# line 1 only, leaving the README install coordinate and the badge at the version
# that shipped, and the reason is required: those two are what a reader copies to
# depend on vaelii, and `X.Y.(Z+1)-SNAPSHOT` is on nobody's Clojars.  A check that
# demanded equality there would turn the branch every pull request targets red,
# which is a worse failure than the drift it is looking for.
#
# So: equal, or this tree is a snapshot and the other names a plain release.  That
# second arm is what a released coordinate looks like and nothing else — the drift
# this check exists for left a *snapshot* behind (a README reading `0.3.0`
# beside a `0.4.0` defproject), so it is still caught, and so is a
# coordinate left at an older snapshot in any tree.
