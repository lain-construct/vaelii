#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/test-sweeps.sh — run the whole suite once per ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION
# and report a ✔ / ✘ per test namespace as it goes, then one per run.
#
# The other axis the suite can be run on.  `test-backends.sh` varies where the
# sentexes live; this varies which implementation answers, holding storage at the
# default.  Five switches `test_util.clj` reads each re-run the whole suite through
# a component the engine otherwise picks for itself:
#
#   tms-reference  VAELII_TEST_TMS=reference    the persistent-map JTMS instead of the
#                                               default dense one
#   rete           VAELII_RETE=1                the RETE-ish sweep instead of the
#                                               re-derivation fixpoint
#   query-engine   VAELII_QUERY_ENGINE=…        the node engine instead of the goal-stack DFS
#   tactician      …plus VAELII_QUERY_STRATEGY  one of the node engine's orderings
#   hier-off       VAELII_HIER=0                the reference nested fan-out instead of
#                                               the set-algebra context retrieval
#
# Each is a COST decision rather than a semantic one — a tactician orders goals, it
# does not choose answers — so the suite must be **failing-set-identical** across all
# six and against a plain `lein test`.  A sweep that answers differently is a bug in
# the alternative, not a feature of it: running these by hand is what found a clash
# reported against a different sentex depending on which retrieval path answered.
#
# The ASSERTION COUNT is identical here too, as it is in `test-backends.sh`.  Where an
# assertion pins an artifact of one implementation — `prove` returns one solution per
# derivation on the DFS and one per answer on the node engine, so counting its results
# is an engine-specific number (docs/inference.md) — the test asserts the number for
# the engine in force, read off `tu/query-engine-override`, rather than standing
# aside.  A count that moves is a run that skipped something.
#
# CHECKED at the foot of this script rather than left to be read: `config_expected_delta`
# in scripts/lib/suite-configs.sh holds the expected shortfall, zero for every
# configuration, and any other fails the run.  Standing aside silently is the thing
# being made impossible; a configuration that had to would be recorded there with its
# reason.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A CI JOB.  It is both, and the local one is the
# gate.  `deep.yml` runs these six and the nine backends on a runner, which is
# 240 job-minutes against a 2,000-minute monthly allowance — eight runs a month,
# for a matrix a release wants once.  The same coverage here costs wall time and
# no money, so the CI job is the confirmation and this is what you run before a
# cut.  `lein gate` covers neither: it is one backend and every switch at its
# default, which is what keeps it a check you run before every landing.
#
# Runs here are SEQUENTIAL for the reason `test-backends.sh` gives — one run at a time
# is one readable wall time, on a box somebody is still using — and not because
# anything forbids sharing: these six write no durable store at all.
# **`scripts/test-matrix.sh` is the concurrent one**, these six and the nine backends
# at once in ~13 minutes rather than ~55, and it is what to run when a change owes the
# matrix.  This script is for one sweep, or for a timing that means something.
#
# A leading-colon argument is a TEST SELECTOR passed straight to `lein test`.
# `:default` — what a bare run takes — skips the `^:slow` tests; `:all` is the
# one to run before a release, and the one `deep.yml` uses.  A non-default
# selector writes `<sweep>.<selector>.log`, so passes at two selectors sit beside
# each other.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-sweeps.sh                     # all six, :default
#   ./scripts/test-sweeps.sh :all                # all six, slow tests included
#   ./scripts/test-sweeps.sh query-engine        # only this one
#   ./scripts/test-sweeps.sh :all rete tms-reference
#   ./scripts/test-sweeps.sh --fail-fast
#
# Env:
#   TEST_SWEEPS_OUT   log directory (default target/test-sweeps)
#   SUITE_PROGRESS    marks | lines | auto (default: marks on a terminal, lines into
#                     anything else — `test-backends.sh` says why)
#
# Progress and the revision read exactly as they do there: a ✔/✘ per namespace as it
# finishes, named rather than marked when the output is not a terminal, and the
# revision on the header, on every summary row and at the top of every log — read per
# run, so a commit landing mid-matrix is called out rather than left to look like a
# run that skipped something.
#
# ^C stops the suite that is running and then the script.
#
# Exit: 0 when every sweep passed, 1 when one failed, 130 when interrupted.
