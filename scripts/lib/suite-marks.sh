# scripts/lib/suite-marks.sh — the per-namespace progress marks, shared by the two
# scripts that run the whole suite more than once.
#
# `test-backends.sh` varies STORAGE and `test-sweeps.sh` varies the ENGINE
# implementation the suite runs against, but a run is a run: both boot a JVM,
# load every test namespace, and then take twenty minutes saying nothing unless
# somebody makes them.  This file is the making-them, and it lives here so the
# two scripts share one answer rather than two that drift.
#
# What is NOT here: each script's run loop, its interrupt handling and its
# summary.  Those touch variables only the caller has — a disk directory to
# clean, an env list to build — and generalizing them would buy indirection
# rather than reuse.  The rule for what belongs in this file is that it reads
# only its arguments.
#
# Sourced, never executed:
#   . scripts/lib/suite-marks.sh
#
# Every name below is read by the sourcing script and by nothing in here, which is
# what a library is and what SC2034 cannot see across a `.` boundary — hence the
# file-level disable rather than one per assignment.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
