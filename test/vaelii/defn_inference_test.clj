  "Query-time definitional *inference*.  Two behaviours this suite pins, both TDD-red
  until the build lands:

  1. **Evaluative `defnSufficient`.**  A sufficient condition built from *computed*
     predicates (`integer`, `lessThan`, or any `add-evaluatable` check) must admit a
     member by **evaluating the condition at query time** — not only by a forward rule
     firing on an already-*believed* condition.  Computed conditions are never stored
     sentexes (see `evaluatable-test`), so the forward rule never fires and the member
     is never derived today.  This is the wall the `-212` predAll demo hit.

  2. **Admittance precedence + fast-fail over the genl lattice.**  A `defnSufficient`
     never admits a member that fails any `defnNecessary` of the collection or its
     genls (necessary wins).  The admittance walk checks each defn **once** on success
     and **short-circuits** on the first failing necessary — checking the most general
     necessary before descending to a spec's sufficient, and never re-checking a defn
     reachable by two genl paths.

  Call-counts are observed the honest way: each defn's condition is an `add-evaluatable`
  predicate backed by a counter atom, so the count is a side effect of the real
  admittance walk, not a peek into its internals."
