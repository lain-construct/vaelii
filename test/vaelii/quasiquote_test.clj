  "Quasiquotation — the metalinguistic constructor (docs/nat.md, the plan).

  `(Quasiquote T)` builds the syntactic term `T` with each `(Unquote v)` hole filled and
  names the result as syntax — a `Quote` mention reified to a constant.  A ground template
  reduces on the write path; an open one reduces at rule-firing time once the antecedent
  binds its holes, deterministically (content-addressed dedup) so a re-derivation converges."
