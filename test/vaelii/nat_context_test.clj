  "**Object** reified NATs are not contexts — docs/nat.md, docs/naming.md, docs/contexts.md.
  (Context-denoting `Cx*Fn` NATs reify to a `cx/` constant that *is* a context — that is
  the deliberate exception, and its own contract is `docs/context-nat.md` +
  `context_nat_test`.  This namespace pins the object case that stays refused.)

  An object reified NAT is an opaque `nat/`-namespaced constant standing for a term; a
  context is a `Cx`-prefixed name (or a `cx/` context constant).  For an object NAT the two
  roles are orthogonal — reification settles *term identity*, a context is *where a sentex
  is stored* — and nothing bridges them, so a `nat/` constant can neither be wired into the
  `genlCx` hierarchy nor name the context a sentex is stored in.  Two independent gates hold
  the line, and this namespace pins both:

  - `wff/genlCx-problems` refuses a `genlCx` edge whose argument is not `Cx`-shaped
    (`:not-well-formed`), so a reified constant can never become a node of the hierarchy;
  - the naming check refuses a context slot that is not a context name (`:naming`), so a
    reified constant cannot name where a sentex is stored either.

  The refusal is an entry-point **policy**, not a store limit: with `:naming :off` the
  store will hold a sentex keyed by a `nat/` symbol — but genlCx still refuses to wire
  it, so it is an island that sees nothing and no context sees, never a member of
  `(contexts kb)`.  A reified NAT as a working context is therefore unreachable under
  every policy."
