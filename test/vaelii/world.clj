  "The test-world: the individuals, facts, and worked fables the shipped schema no
  longer carries.  The starter (vaelii.impl.starter) ships schema only — types,
  relations, and the theory rules — so the reasoning it demonstrates needs data to
  run on.  That data lives here, in the tests, below CxWell.

  Topology — the data contexts hang off CxWell, the bottom of the shipped
  spindle, so each sees the whole ontology (every middle theory, every upper
  definition) but not its siblings:

      CxWell
        CxNaturalWorld   the cast's type memberships + natural-world facts
        CxSocialWorld    social-world facts
        CxStories        the Aesop fables + story-understanding schema

  The cast is told twice over about one of its animals, deliberately.  `(asleep Whiskers)`
  is the timeless reading CxBiology's awake-until-told-otherwise default handles; the same
  cat's afternoon is also written as events and fluents, which is what CxChange's inertia
  reads to answer whether it is asleep at four and awake at six.  The two say different
  things and neither derives the other.

  The cast's type memberships live in CxNaturalWorld, so the biology and kinship
  theories — which every CxWell descendant sees — place their conclusions back in
  CxNaturalWorld, where the tests query them.  Social facts sit in a sibling
  CxSocialWorld, so a rule joining an owns-fact with a natural-world partOf-fact
  finds no shared context and does not fire — the placement isolation the tests check.

  `load-into` layers onto a KB that already has the starter schema."

  terms and nothing has to be held opaque to identity congruence.

  In CxWell, the bottom anchor, because two data contexts use them: the cat's afternoon in
  CxNaturalWorld and the hare's nap in CxTortoiseHare, which are siblings and see each
  other not at all."

(def timed-day
  "Whiskers' afternoon, as CxChange reads it: four moments, two events, and what each
  event starts and stops.  Nobody states that the cat is asleep at four — that is
  inertia's answer, and the whole point of writing the afternoon this way rather than as
  the timeless `(asleep Whiskers)` CxBiology already handles.

  The ordering is four moments and the three links between them.  `instantBefore` is
  declared transitive, and a forward join over a transitive antecedent reads the closure,
  so `clipped` sees three o'clock before six without the narrative saying so (CxChange)."
