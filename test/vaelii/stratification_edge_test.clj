  "Stratification when a **taxonomy edge** is what closes the cycle, rather than a
  rule.  See the Stratification section of
  [docs/exceptions.md](../../docs/exceptions.md).

  Both kinds of edge in the rule dependency graph fan out over the genl **spec**
  closure, so a cycle through negation can exist purely because of a `genl` edge: an
  exception on `flightless` is reached by a stored `(penguin Opus)` the moment
  `(genl penguin flightless)` holds.  `stratification_test` covers the case where the
  edge is already there and a rule arrives last; this namespace covers the other
  order, where both rules are stored and the **edge** arrives last.

  Three things to pin, and they are the same three the rule path pins:

  * the edge that closes a cycle is **refused**, and leaves nothing behind — neither
    a sentex nor a taxonomy closure that learned it;
  * an edge that closes nothing is accepted, so the refusal above is attributable to
    the cycle and not to the mere presence of an excepted rule;
  * the walk is **skipped entirely** when no stored rule carries a negative edge, which
    is every rule in the bundled starter and therefore every ordinary `genl` assert.
    Asserted by counting `wff/genl-negation-cycle` calls, not by a clock.

  Plus the derivation path, where the answer is different by necessity: forward
  chaining cannot throw, so a derived edge that would close a cycle is dropped and
  reported in `(v/violations kb)` alongside the definitional constraints.

  House rules as everywhere: gensym'd temporaries via `tu/with-terms`, engine
  vocabulary (`genl`, `genlCx`, `set/defaultRule`, `exceptWhen`) literal, and the
  neutral fixture asserts the KB is restored."

;; ---- the probe's memo is its own -----------------------------------------
;; The stratification probe asks its question of a detached copy of the taxonomy, and
;; the read memo is a **side atom** inside that value — so a copy that kept the
;; reference would let the probe write closures computed over the refused edge into
;; the live memo, stamped one gen ahead of the live relation.  Those entries answer
;; real reads the moment the live gen catches up.  The sequence below arranges exactly
;; that catch-up: a retraction bumps the gen without an intervening closure read (an
;; assert's own checks would recompute-and-clear on the way in; a retraction runs no
;; checks), so a shared memo would serve the refused edge as a real subtype.
