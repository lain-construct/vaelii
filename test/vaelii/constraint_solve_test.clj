  "Constraint rules (`set/hardConstraint` / `set/softConstraint`) and the single-labeling
  `do/label … :one` mode — the grounding-rule → integrity-constraint path that lets a
  solve express a nogood over two *different* individuals (graph adjacency), which the
  direct-clash detectors (always one shared individual) cannot.

  The worked example is graph 3-coloring: a choice of colour per node
  (`assumptionRule`), at-most-one-colour (`functional`), and no-monochrome-edge (a hard
  constraint whose body joins the edge facts against the colour choices).  A single
  `:label` solve keeps a colour for every node (the keep-belief objective) capped at one
  (functional) with no adjacent clash (the hard constraint) — a valid proper colouring.

  Enumeration/solving needs an ASP backend, so the end-to-end tests are guarded on
  `asp?`; the wrapper/record unit tests are not."
