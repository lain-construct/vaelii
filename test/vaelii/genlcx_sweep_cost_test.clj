  "What a `(genlCx sub super)` edge's merge sweep costs, as counted derivations, and the
  two things about that count which are properties of the algorithm rather than of the
  fixture.

  `equate-under-context-edge-via` hands `context-down(sub)` — the contexts whose ancestor
  set this edge changed — to both twins' `derive`, which sweep that set instead of the
  whole reader fan of each candidate's own storage context.

  ## The two claims

  **Flat in readers the edge does not reach.**  Contexts wired under the *candidates'*
  branch and not under `sub` see exactly what they saw before the edge, so the count is
  asserted equal across 0, 4, 8 and 16 of them.  Before the reader set was narrowed this
  count was 25, 49, 73, 121 — one extra derivation per candidate per bystander.  That
  growth is why a `genlCx` edge cost more as a KB gained contexts at all, and why
  `starter/load-into` went from 0.87 s to 2.50 s while the shipped files grew 1,668 ->
  3,200+ sentexes.

  **Linear, at one derivation per candidate, in readers it does reach.**  The same
  contexts wired under `sub` instead do gain visibility, and each one must be swept.  The
  count rises by exactly the candidate count per reader — which is the claim that says the
  narrowing reaches the right set rather than simply doing less: a sweep narrowed to
  nothing would pass the first claim and fail this one.

  ## Why a count, and why a slope rather than a number

  `assert_cost_test`'s reason for the count: the quantity is an integer the engine
  computes, so it is identical across runs and machines and needs no warm-up or
  tolerance.  Its preference for an exact number does not carry here, and the reason is
  measurable — the same fixture at the same size answers 13 in one namespace's KB and 25
  in another's, because a sweep's absolute total also carries what the settle beneath it
  probes, which is a function of the KB the fixture happened to build.  A slope is not:
  one derivation per candidate per swept reader is what the code does, and it reads the
  same whatever the fixture holds.  So the pins here are `=` across bystanders and an
  exact slope across widened readers, and neither can be satisfied by a fixture drifting
  under them.

  `genlcx_sweep_test` holds the other half — the merges the narrowing must still derive,
  and the readers it must not visit."
