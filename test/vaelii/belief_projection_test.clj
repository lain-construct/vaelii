  "Modal belief projection — `(believes Agent P)` answered by proving `P` in `Agent`'s
  own context (`CxAgent<Agent>`) rather than in the asker's.

  The whole capability is one convention (`vaelii.impl.modal`) and one prover
  (`BeliefProjectionProver`) over the context lattice the engine already has, plus a
  `modal_predicate` grant that says which predicates project.  The contract these tests
  hold is that two agents may believe contradictory things without the KB being
  inconsistent — the property the lattice was built to give, and the one no
  Datalog / SPARQL / DL rival can field.  See docs/belief.md."
