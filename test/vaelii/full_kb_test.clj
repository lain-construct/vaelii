  "Probes that read and write a full-size KB and hold each one to a ceiling, so a change
  whose cost grows with the corpus fails here rather than in front of a user.

  The suite's other tests run on KBs of a few thousand sentexes, where a write that walks
  the whole corpus costs the same as one that does not.  The class of regression this
  catches is that one: a guard, a closure walk or a check whose cost is a function of what
  the KB holds rather than of what the write names.  Each probe runs under the counting
  instrument (`vaelii.impl.profile`, the one `assert_cost_test` pins) and reports its
  index operations, record fetches and wall-clock milliseconds.  **A ceiling is a count
  first**: a count does not move with the machine's load, so it can sit close to what a
  probe costs today, and a walk of a full-size corpus lands orders of magnitude over it.
  The millisecond ceiling is the backstop for work no counted call sees, a taxonomy walk
  or a TMS relabel, and is set loose enough for a busy machine.

  ## Two halves

  `^:full-kb` tests open the KB named by `VAELII_FULL_KB_DIR` once per JVM and run every
  probe on it.  Nothing runs them for you: `lein test-full-kb` does
  (`scripts/test-full-kb.sh`), which brings the KB up to this engine and hands the test
  JVM a disposable clone of it.  The probes write into that clone.

  The unmarked twin runs the same probes on the starter plus a few facts, so the harness
  itself runs on every commit and a probe that stops finding its subject fails at
  `:default` rather than on the next full-KB run.  The twin holds no ceiling: on a starter
  KB every probe is cheap whatever the engine does.

  ## The probes

  In this order, in one test, since a write past its deadline leaves every write after
  it skipped — the `known-unbounded` probes last:

  * **reads** — up to `per-context` ground premises and as many ground derived literals
    from every context: each one the KB believes in its context, `ask` answers; and each
    binary one, asked with its second argument open, answers with that argument among the
    bindings.  The report names the costliest reads.
  * **a fact** — a corpus type applied to a new individual, in the corpus context that
    holds the type's sampled fact.
  * **a rule** — a new type concluding the corpus type, and its firing.
  * **retracting them** — in reverse; the corpus context holds what it held and the
    sampled corpus sentexes' belief is what it was.
  * **a corpus premise out and back** — a stored premise something rests on, retracted
    and reasserted under its own strength; what rested on it is believed as before.
  * **the spindle** — `sync-spindle!`, and a second one that finds nothing to do.
  * **a genl edge** — a new type made a spec of the corpus type, and retracted.
  * **a new context** — wired under that corpus context by a `genlCx` edge, the edge that
    reseeds visibility, and retracted."
