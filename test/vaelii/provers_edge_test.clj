  "Prover branches the happy-path tests never reach.

  `provers_test` asks each built-in prover the question it was written for, which
  means every reasoner is exercised in exactly one argument mode — usually
  ground/ground, sometimes with the *first* argument bound.  The other modes are
  separate branches with their own binding maps, and a swapped key there yields
  *wrong answers* rather than an error: an empty result set reads as \"nothing
  matches\", which is indistinguishable from a correct negative.

  Also here: the two recursion/exception guards that `ask` and `backward` own
  privately, which the `prove`-based tests cannot cover."
