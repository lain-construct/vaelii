  `serve/app` — pure `request -> response`, so no socket.

  One property runs under all of them and is why they are here rather than trusted:
  **a reply has to survive `pr-str` and `edn/read-string`**, which is the whole of what
  crossing the wire is.  Every failure this file exists to catch is invisible to a
  local call — a `java.util.Set` that is not an `IPersistentSet` prints as
  `#object[…]`, a continuation prints as a function, a record prints as `#vaelii…` —
  and each answers `200 {:ok true}` on the way out.

  `wire-clean?` is therefore the assertion, not `:ok`."
