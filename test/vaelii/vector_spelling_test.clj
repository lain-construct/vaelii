  "One spelling, one meaning: a top-level **vector is a conjunction** at every door.

  A vector is `sequential?`, so `sentex/canon` flattens `[likes Tom Ann]` to the list it
  looks like — while `query` and `prove` read a vector as a join over its members.  The
  write door refuses the collision (`sentence-shape-problem`), and this pins the read
  side of it, which is where the same knowledge answered two ways:

    a sentence written as a vector   `ask` / `sentexes-matching` / `handle-of` said the
                                     fact was there, `prove` / `query` joined over its
                                     three symbols and answered nothing
    a conjunction written as one     `prove` / `query` joined it, `ask` flattened it into
                                     a sentence nothing matches and answered **false**

  Neither raised.  Both directions are refused now, and the tests below are written as a
  roster of doors rather than as one assertion each, because the defect was never in one
  door — it was in two doors disagreeing, and a roster is what fails when the next door
  is added on one side only."
