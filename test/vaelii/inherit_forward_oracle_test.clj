  "The correctness gate for forward chaining on an inherited claim.

  Preservation lets a rule fire on a claim nobody stored, so the fixpoint reaches
  conclusions no stored fact unifies with — and every failure on that path is a
  **missing** answer rather than a wrong one.  A KB that is merely less informative
  than it should be reads as correct against anything except a second KB that was told
  the same thing another way, so this file is two of those.

    * **materialization** — a KB handed one general claim and a taxonomy must derive
      exactly what a KB handed every claim that general one licenses derives, over a
      randomized assert/retract stream compared after *every* operation.  The reference
      is rebuilt from the surviving claims each step, so an incremental path that fails
      to re-join, or re-joins what it should not, diverges at the operation that caused
      it.  The **justifications** are compared as well, projected to the conclusion,
      the rule and the strength: their antecedent lists differ by construction — a
      materialized claim rests on itself, an inherited one on the claim, the
      declaration and the reach edges — and that difference is the whole feature.

    * **order** — the same content in eight orders, from nothing each time, must reach
      the identical derived set *and* the identical justifications, antecedent sets
      included.  Which witness a firing names is meant to be a function of the content
      (a shortest reach path, neighbours in term order, ties broken on a context name),
      and this is what says so.  Rules are permuted with the facts, since \"the rule
      arrived last\" is what a rule's own full join would otherwise paper over, and the
      shapes are the awkward ones: a default general claim, an asymmetric predicate's
      converse stated one level down, and an explicit denial of one tuple."
