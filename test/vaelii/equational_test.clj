  "Symbolic (schematic) equational reasoning — the gap docs/equality.md names.

  Two pieces, on top of ground congruence (which is already free — a `(equals a b)`
  over symbols rewrites every sentex mentioning `a`, at any nesting, via the inverted
  term index; see `ground-congruence-is-free` below):

  * **Part A — compound equality over reifiable NATs.**  `(equals (MotherOf Alice)
    (MotherOf Bob))` — *Alice and Bob have the same mother, so they are siblings* —
    is accepted when `MotherOf` is a `reifiable_function`.  It reduces to ordinary
    individual equality: each side reifies to its constant *before* wff runs
    (docs/nat.md), so `(equals K1 K2)` merges in the partition and a fact about one
    holds of the other.  A compound equality that does **not** reduce — a structural NAT
    measure like `(QuantityFn 5 Kilogram)` — stays refused.

  * **Part B — schematic equational rules.**  `(equals (fatherOf (fatherOf ?x))
    (grandfather_of ?x))` is an oriented rewrite `fatherOf∘fatherOf → grandfather_of`.
    A stored `(parent_chain (fatherOf (fatherOf Tom)))` normalizes to `(parent_chain
    (grandfather_of Tom))`, so a query on the `grandfather_of` normal form matches.
    Oriented by a reduction order (strict size decrease + the variable condition), so
    rewriting terminates.

  Both are belief-following: every rewrite is a JTMS-justified twin, so retracting
  the equation collects the rewrites and revives the originals — exactly the
  discipline ground migration already has.

  House rules: gensym'd temporaries via `tu/with-terms`; engine vocabulary
  (`equals`, `reifiable_function`, `QuantityFn`, `Kilogram`, contexts) literal; the
  neutral fixture asserts the KB is restored.  CxCore is loaded because the NAT
  bookkeeping (`termOfUnit`, `result`) rides real vocabulary."
