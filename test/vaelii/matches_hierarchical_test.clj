  "Oracle for the set-algebra retrieval (`res/matches-hierarchical`).

  `matches-visible` answers `(p a ?x)` visible from `c` by a product of lookups —
  `|context-up(c)|` contexts × `|specs(p)|` sub-predicates.  The hierarchical path
  leads with the bound argument's root (one lookup, spanning every functor and
  context) and filters the predicate and context hierarchies in memory.  The claim is
  it returns the **identical** `[handle bindings]` set.  This pins that against the
  nested fan-out (flag off) over patterns generated from the test-world's own facts,
  across concrete and variable contexts, symmetric predicates, negative literals (the
  fallback), and — with a temporary predicate-genl edge — predicate subsumption.

  **The fixture loads the world, and every probe here depends on it.** The starter is
  schema: it declares `parentOf` and `siblingOf` and asserts no instance of either, and
  the contexts these patterns name (`CxMantle`, `CxSocialWorld`, …) are the
  world's. Loaded without it, each comparison below is `#{}` against `#{}` — two paths
  agreeing about nothing, which is what an oracle looks like when it has stopped
  oracling. `probed` is the standing check against that: it counts the non-empty
  comparisons and fails when a run makes none."

  `lead-candidates` reads from is a pure cost decision, so all four must be the identical
  set.

  **The literal cache is off for the comparison, and that is what makes it one.**
  `*lead-side*` is not part of `matches-visible`'s cache key — nothing in the engine
  rebinds it, so keying on it would only fragment the cache — which means the second and
  third arms here would be served the first arm's answer and the oracle would be checking
  a result against itself.  `lead_side_cost_test` pins the same switch off for the cost
