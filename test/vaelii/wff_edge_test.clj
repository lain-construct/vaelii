  "The well-formedness checkers that had no tests, and the error *contract*.

  The wff dispatch (the `:wff` column of `vaelii.impl.special`'s table, walked by
  `special/wff-problems`) routes each special predicate to its checker.  `genl` and
  `arg` are covered; `genlCx`'s cycle branch, `disjoint_metatype`, the six
  predicate properties routed through `prop-problems`, and `inverse` are not — so a
  predicate whose entry loses its `:wff` arm falls through to `[]` and is accepted
  unchecked, with nothing to notice.

  The second half is about how a refusal is *reported*.  The contract is
  that every `ex-info` `assert` throws carries a `:type` — `:naming`
  `:not-well-formed` `:not-ground` `:arg-type` `:disjoint` `:functional` — so a
  caller can discriminate without guessing from which keys happen to be present.
  Six of those eight were asserted nowhere: every test used a bare
  `(thrown? ExceptionInfo ...)`, which passes just as happily when the check
  regresses into throwing for a *different* reason.  `stratification_test` names
  that risk in its own docstring; this holds the rest of the error paths to the same
  bar."
