  "A koinii scheduling conversation, over real calendar dates.  Three teammates — Ada, Bo
  and Cyra — try to book a design review before their sprint ends, and the KB carries the
  whole discussion: the date proposed, who cannot make it, the reasons, the ballots, the
  dispute standing open while the house is split, the majority that settles it, and — when
  the calendar is over-constrained enough that no hand-agreement is possible — the answer
  the ASP solver finds that the team could not.  Every move is a sentex, so afterwards a
  plain query answers 'what date, who objected, why, and how it was decided.'

  Dates are `DatetimeFn` terms (`docs/nat.md`, `docs/context-nat.md`) — `(DatetimeFn
  \"2026-03-10\")` is Tuesday the 10th — asserted as ordinary koinii claim content and read
  back by calendar containment (`datetime/subinterval?`: is the chosen day inside the sprint
  month?).  Two shapes of the same story:

  - **the argument** (in-process, no solver) — Ada proposes a date, Bo (away that day)
    disputes it, the house is split 1-1 and stays honestly OPEN (Priest's LP), and a third
    ballot carries it 2-1.  Composes the koinii dispute reads, the channel, and majority
    adjudication — the roommates story, but the subject is a calendar date.
  - **the solve** (guarded on the ASP solver) — the team's availability is over-constrained:
    every candidate day is blocked by someone, so `do/label` finds ZERO feasible schedules
    (the conflict, as answer-set unsatisfiability).  Then Cyra frees a day, and the solver
    returns the ONE date that works — real constraint solving over the calendar, resolving a
    schedule the teammates could not settle by hand (`docs/solving.md`, `docs/labeling.md`).

  Plain `deftest`s, each over its own fresh KB (not the net-neutral `deftest-kb` fixture):
  `do/label` materializes an inert labeling context that the teardown check would flag as a
  leak, which is why every solving test builds a disposable KB instead.  The solve degrades:
  with no clingo/clasp present `(solver/available?)` is false and that test no-ops."
