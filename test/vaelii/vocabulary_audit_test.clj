  "Declared and enforced, against declared and ignored.

  Nothing about a declaration's *shape* says whether anything reads it.
  `(maxCardinality parentOf 2)` is a well-formed ternary fact, storable, believed, and
  read by nobody — so a KB author gets identical silence from a constraint that is
  enforced and one that was never implemented.  `vaelii.impl.vocabulary` answers the
  question for the engine's own grammar, and these tests are what keep the answer true:
  a term `CxCore` declares that the roster says nothing about fails here, and so
  does a roster entry naming a term the grammar has retired.

  A CxCore baseline is the whole population, which is why this is its own namespace
  — the constraint tests beside it (`constraint-vocabulary-test`) need a cleared KB."
