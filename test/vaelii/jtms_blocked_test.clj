  "Blocked justifications: `exceptWhen` seen from inside the TMS.

  A rule may carry an exception, and when that exception holds for a particular
  derivation the justification is **blocked** — it supports nothing.  The TMS is pure
  and has no KB, so it cannot run the exception query itself: the answer is computed
  outside and handed in with `jtms/set-blocked`.

  These tests are **pure** — no store, no fixture.  `nmtms_test.clj` drives
  the same machinery end-to-end through `vaelii.core`; here the graph is built by hand
  so a claim about the *region* a relabel touches is checkable rather than inferred
  from a timing.  Both invariants of docs/nmtms.md are covered: order independence
  (the same blocked set reached by different routes lands in the same state) and
  locality (blocking seeds the region from the changed justifications' consequences,
  so the work is flat in graph size)."
