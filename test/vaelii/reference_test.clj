  "The engine's belief against the belief reference (docs/reference.md), and against
  itself across arrival orders.

  Two kinds of test:

  - **Fixed worlds.** Scenarios run in every arrival order of the writes that can move,
    with the expected belief at named contexts written out.  These need no reference.
  - **Random worlds.** `vaelii.ref.gen/gen-world` over a fixed seed set, each world run in
    every permutation of its writes when it has at most `exhaustive-up-to` of them and in
    a seeded sample of orders otherwise.  The reference judges every write offered
    (decision D8): a write the engine refuses is a divergence of kind
    `:engine-refused-other`, and every belief disagreement of a run that refused nothing is shrunk and
    classified (`gen/divergences`).

  **The known-divergence rule.** A divergence whose `:kind` is a key of
  `known-divergences` is counted and printed, one line per kind; any other kind fails
  the test, with one summary line per divergence and its EDN report under
  `gen/default-report-dir`.  No divergence is dropped without being counted.

  Every KB here is an in-RAM KB on a space of its own, opened by `gen/load-world!` and
  closed with its stores dropped in a `finally`, so no test shares a store with another
  and none uses the `vaelii.test-util` fixtures or their net-neutrality check: a KB that
  is closed and dropped leaves nothing behind to check."
