  "`kb-quality` — the seven readings about the knowledge rather than about the engine.

  Every reading is a claim about a KB whose answer is known by construction, because that
  is the only way a distribution can be checked: a rule that fires twice, one that never
  fires, one whose every conclusion is defeated and one retracted after firing all look the
  same from a firing count alone, and the whole point of the census is that they do not
  land in the same category.

  The one test here that is not about correctness is
  `a-densely-cyclic-rule-graph-condenses-instead-of-re-exploring-it`.  A rule graph is
  cyclic in the ordinary case, and the failure it guards against is not a wrong answer, it
  is a report that never returns."
