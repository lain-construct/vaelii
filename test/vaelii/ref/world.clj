  "The world a belief reference reads: the premises a KB stores, as a plain value.

  A world is `{:contexts #{…} :writes [{:sentence S :context C :strength s} …]}`. A write
  is a premise: a ground fact, a denial `(not S)`, a taxonomy edge, a definitional
  declaration, or a forward rule. A derived sentex is never a write. The order of
  `:writes` carries no meaning; the vector exists so a generator can permute it.

  `check-world` holds a world to the v1 fragment and throws `(ex-info … {:type
  :unsupported})` on anything outside it, so a generator or an extraction cannot produce
  a shape the reference does not model. The fragment, by write kind:

  - **fact**: `(p a1 … an)`, `p` an ordinary predicate (no entry in
    `vaelii.impl.predicates`, and none of the special words below), every argument a
    constant symbol.
  - **genl edge**: `(genl a b)`, two constant symbols.
  - **genlCx edge**: `(genlCx Sub Super)`, two `Cx…` symbols, written `:monotonic`. The
    genlCx edges together are acyclic.
  - **declaration**: `(d a1 … an)` with `d` in `declaration-predicates`, every argument a
    constant symbol or an integer. A `transitiveInArgInverse` declaration is `(transitiveInArgInverse
    P k genl)`, `P` an ordinary predicate and `k` a positive integer.
  - **denial**: `(not S)` with `S` a fact, a `genl` edge, or a write of the
    forced-monotonic roster.
  - **rule**: the shapes `parse-rule` accepts.

  **The forced-monotonic roster** (`forced?`, docs/reference.md D1, D7, D10–D13 and
  D17): `genlCx`, the relation marks, the function classes, the definitional
  declarations, `except`, the equality predicates, and a `genl` between two predicates
  (`predicate-genl?`). A write of one keeps the strength it was written at and is never
  the loser of a nogood (`vaelii.ref.believe/decide`), except a `genlCx` write, which is
  read `:monotonic` whatever strength it was written at (`force-monotonic`, D1), as the
  engine's labeller holds it. A write the roster rules out is stored and inert, never
  refused (`inert-write?`): a denial of a roster literal, and a rule concluding one, whose
  antecedents in v1 are never roster literals. `check-world` sets the inert writes aside
  under `:inert`. v1 admits `genlCx`, the marks, `disjoint`, `covering` and a predicate
  `genl`; the rest of the roster is outside v1.

  Refused besides (`check-computed-reads`): a rule that reads a predicate some write
  declares `transitiveInArgInverse`, or a positive literal on a predicate the written `genl`
  edges put above one, because the engine satisfies such an antecedent with a claim
  nobody stored (docs/inference.md, \"Antecedents nothing stored\"), and an `unknown` or
  `exceptWhen` conjunct on a part of some `covering`, which level 6 answers through
  `CoveringProver`. The reference models neither reading."

  `:rule` is the bare `(implies …)` with every wrapper removed; it and the write's context
  identify the rule sentex, so two spellings of one rule are one rule only when their
  bare forms are `=`. `:antecedents` are the join literals (a literal or a denial of one,

  `:exceptions` holds the one conjunct vector the `exceptWhen` wrappers of this form

  The accepted shape follows docs/inference.md (\"Rules are sentexes\", \"Rule
  direction\"), docs/naf.md (\"In a rule antecedent\") and docs/exceptions.md (\"The
  exception is a query, not a literal\"):

  - wrappers in any order: exactly one forward direction (`set/forwardRule` or
    `set/forwardOnlyRule`), optionally `set/defaultRule`, optionally `(exceptWhen Q R)`
    with `Q` a literal or a vector of literals. A bare `implies` is backward-only, which
    stores no conclusion, and is refused, as are the other `set/*` wrappers.
  - `(implies A C)`, `A` one antecedent or `(and A1 A2 …)`, no nested `and`.
  - an antecedent is a literal or its denial over an ordinary predicate, or
    `(unknown L)` / `(unknown (and L1 L2 …))` over positive literals. A negated literal
    inside `unknown` or `exceptWhen` is refused: the engine answers one there through
    level-6 provers (disjointness among them) the reference does not model.
  - `C` is a literal or its denial over an ordinary predicate, or a member of the
    forced-monotonic roster (`forced?`) or its denial. A rule concluding a roster member
    parses with `:inert? true` (docs/reference.md D17): its antecedents are v1 literals,
    never roster literals, so each firing of it is inert. A rule concluding a type-level
    `genl` or a rule is refused as outside v1.
  - at least one join antecedent; every variable of `C`, of each `unknown` and of the
    exception occurs in a join antecedent (range restriction and closure)."
