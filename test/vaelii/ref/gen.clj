  "Random worlds inside the reference's v1 fragment, the loader that asserts a world into
  a fresh KB in a given order, the reader of the engine's belief per context, the
  comparators (engine against reference, engine against engine across orders, and a
  report's `:grounds` against the reference's `:ground`), the divergence classifier, the
  shrinker and the failure report.

  A **world** is `{:contexts #{C ...} :writes [{:sentence S :context C :strength k} ...]}`
  (the belief reference design note).  An **order** is a vector holding each write of a
  world once, so an order stays meaningful after the shrinker drops a write: dropping it
  from every order is `filterv`.

  This namespace requires no reference namespace.  The caller passes the reference in
  `check-world`'s judges map as `:reference`, a function `world -> {C {:believed #{S}
  :out #{S} :inherited #{S} :nogoods [...]}}`.

  **The reference judges every write offered** (decision D8).  A write the engine refuses
  is not dropped from the reference's world: the run records the refusal as a divergence
  of kind `:engine-refused-other` (`refusal-kind`), and the belief differences of that
  run are reported under that divergence and never as belief disagreements.  Every belief
  disagreement of a run with no refusal is shrunk to a minimal world and given a `:kind`
  by `classify`.

  Every KB this namespace opens is an in-RAM KB on a space of its own
  (`[::ref n]`, `n` from a process counter).  `run-order` and every caller of it
  close the KB and drop both RAM stores in a `finally`; `load-world!` hands the open KB
  to its caller, who closes it with `close-kb!`."

    :message m :runs n :belief-differences n}`, the belief differences summed over the

  - one per `[context sentence engine-answer]` of the reference disagreements,
    `{:kind k :category :reference :context :sentence :engine :reference :orders [o …]
    :world minimal :minimal d}`: the world shrunk while that disagreement persists
    (`shrink`, `failing-under` over at most two of the orders it was read in), and `k`
    from `classify` on the minimal world;
  - one per member set whose report's `:grounds` differ from the reference's
    declarations (`grounds-disagreements`), `{:kind :grounds-differ :category :grounds
    :members :engine :reference :vantages :orders [o …]}`;
  - one per context and pair of merge sets that differ (`merge-disagreements`),
    `{:kind :merge-differs :category :merges :context :engine :reference :orders [o …]}`;
  - one per `[context sentence]` of `:displaced`, a spelling the engine's own merge
    displaces at a context the belief comparison skips and the engine believes there,
    `{:kind :displaced-spelling :category :displaced-spelling :context :sentence :orders
    [o …]}`;
  - one per recovered disagreement, `{:kind :recover-differs :category :recovered

  - one per engine-against-engine disagreement no divergence above accounts for (none
    is expected: a disagreement between two runs that refused nothing is a reference
    disagreement of one of them, and one between two runs that refused the same writes
    is reported under those refusals), `{:kind :unclassified :category :orders …}`."
