  "The definitional and inherited nogood families of the belief reference, as pure
  functions of a **view** at one context.

  A view is the map `vaelii.ref.believe` builds for a context C. A family reads three of
  its keys and nothing else:

  - `:believed`, the set of ground sentences believed at C, a denial spelled `(not S)`;
  - `:class`, a function from a sentence to `:monotonic` or `:default` (nil when the
    sentence is not believed);
  - `:genl`, a function from a term to the set holding the term and every believed
    supertype of it at C. Types and predicates share the one closure.

  A family returns a vector of nogoods `{:kind :members :ground}`. `:members` is the set
  of believed sentences that cannot all hold. `:ground` is the set of believed
  declarations and `genl` edges the conviction is read through. Members and `:ground` are
  disjoint for every definitional family (docs/nmtms.md, \"What qualifies as a nogood\":
  the separations and marks are read through and never members). The inherited family
  puts its reasons in `:members` and leaves `:ground` empty (docs/inherit.md, \"A
  contrary claim against a known-true one is a contradiction, and is reported\").

  Each family collects its nogoods by member set, so one set of members convicted by two
  declarations is one nogood whose `:ground` holds both. The vector is sorted on a
  printed content key. No function here picks the first element of a set, so the output
  is a function of the view's content and not of the order a set iterates in.

  A `genl` edge in `:ground` or in `:members` is a believed `(genl u v)` sentence lying on
  a route between the two terms the conviction relates: `u` is in the lower term's
  closure and the upper term is in `v`'s. An edge the view's `:genl` answers but no
  believed `genl` sentence states, such as the part edges a believed `covering` installs
  (docs/taxonomy.md, \"A cover states the specialization it rests on\"), convicts through
  the closure and is absent from `:ground`.

  **The reach of a relation mark** (decision D7 of docs/reference.md). A mark on `P`
  (`functional`, `functionalInArg`, `asymmetric`, `irreflexive`, `anti_symmetric`,
  `anti_transitive`) constrains a tuple `(Q ...)` when `P` is in `((:genl view) Q)`. The
  view's `:genl` is the closure over the `genl` sentences believed at C, whatever their
  class. So an edge OUT at C does not carry the mark to C, and a `:default` edge carries
  it exactly as a `:monotonic` edge does. The route edges go in `:ground`, and the
  decision never weighs `:ground`, so an edge's class never changes a verdict. No family
  reads the class of a mark: the marks are forced `:monotonic`, and `vaelii.ref.believe`
  enforces that.

  A nogood may have one member: an `irreflexive` self tuple is convicted alone, and the
  decision weighs a one-member nogood like any other (a `:default` member is OUT, a
  `:monotonic` one is a hard clash). Each family states its own minimum member count;
  `collect` drops no set for its size.

  `families` is the vector `vaelii.ref.believe` decides. No clash is refused (decision
  D8): every conviction here is a nogood.

  Left out, and for the world extraction to refuse rather than for this namespace to
  read: `disjoint_metatype`, `sibling_disjoint`, `separating`, `partition`,
  `orthogonal`, `siblingDisjointException`, `transitiveInArg`, a `transitiveInArgInverse` over any
  relation but `genl`, and an `asymmetric`, `anti_symmetric` or `anti_transitive` step
  reached only by argument preservation.")

  A believed `(disjoint t1 t2)` with `t1` distinct from `t2` convicts two distinct
  believed memberships `(a X)` and `(b X)` of one term when `t1` is in `a`'s `genl`
  closure and `t2` in `b`'s, or the reverse. Members: the two memberships. `:ground`: the
  declaration and the `genl` edges on the routes from `a` and `b` up to the separated
  types. Any term is separated, not only an individual, so a predicate holding two
  separated types is convicted the same way.

  The explicit arm reads no genl-relatedness guard (docs/taxonomy.md): `(disjoint dog
  animal)` with `(genl dog animal)` convicts `(dog Fido)` beside `(animal Fido)`. The
  write entry point refuses such a declaration when the edge is visible first, and admits
  it when the edge arrives after it.

  `(disjoint a b)` and `(disjoint b a)` both believed make one nogood per pair of
  memberships, with both declarations in `:ground`.

  A declaration over two types one of which is in the other's closure is a one-member
  nogood of the declaration itself, `:ground` the edges of the routes between them
  (decision 8; the ruling on settle prompt 54, item 3). The declaration is forced
  `:monotonic`, so the nogood is a hard clash and moves no belief. One membership whose own
  closure holds both separated types convicts nothing: `(disjoint dog animal)`, `(genl dog
  animal)` and `(dog Fido)` leave `(dog Fido)` believed."

  `(functional P)` constrains position 2 of a binary tuple. `(functionalInArg P n)`
  constrains position `n` (one-based) of a tuple of any arity of at least `n`, and every
  other position together is the determinant; with arity 1 the determinant is empty and
  any two tuples are compared. A mark is read up the predicate hierarchy: a tuple `(Q
  ...)` is constrained by a mark on any `P` in `Q`'s `genl` closure. Two distinct
  believed tuples of equal arity, each under the marked `P`, agreeing on every position

  The fillers may be of any kind, symbols included (decision D6 of docs/reference.md). A
  collision is an ordinary nogood: the unique `:default` tuple loses, and two tied
  `:default` tuples are a dilemma. Two symbol fillers with every member `:monotonic` are
  the one case the engine merges through a derived `(equals V1 V2)`. This family returns
  that pair as a nogood too, and `vaelii.ref.believe/decide` gives it the verdict
  `:merge`, which takes nobody OUT. No collision is refused (decision D8): two

  The one-position downward form. A believed `(transitiveInArgInverse P k genl)` and a believed
  general claim `(P ... sup ...)`, `sup` at position `k`, reach `(P ... sub ...)` for
  every `sub` below `sup` through believed `genl` edges, the other positions unchanged. A
  believed denial `(not (P ... sub ...))` clashes with the reached claim. Members: the
  denial, the general claim, the declaration, and the edges of one route from `sub` up to
  `sup`. `:ground` is empty: the reasons are members, because a reached claim has no
  sentence of its own for a defeat to take out. The family forms one nogood per general
  claim and per acyclic route.

  A general claim whose class at the view's context is `:default` is undercut: it does
  not reach the denied tuple and forms no nogood. The diagonal is excluded: a claim at the
  denied tuple itself pairs with the denial as a negation nogood, which belongs to no
  family here.

  Left out: `transitiveInArg`; a relation other than `genl` (a `(transitive R)`
  relation, `genlCx`); a claim reached by moving two positions at once, as two
  declarations on one predicate license; a general claim spelled at a sub-predicate of
  `P`; the symmetric mirror, and an `asymmetric` converse as the denying side.

  TODO(spec): the engine names one reading per denial, the reading of highest class and
  the first in content order among equal ones (docs/inherit.md, \"A claim read over
  several routes opposes at its strongest reading\"); this family forms one nogood per
  reading. Smallest view where the two differ, every sentence `:monotonic` except the
  three edges: `(transitiveInArgInverse P 1 genl)`, `(P sup X)`, `(not (P sub X))`, and `(genl
  sub mid)`, `(genl mid sup)`, `(genl sub sup)` each `:default`. The two-edge reading is

  in `Q`'s `genl` closure. Members: the self tuple alone, a one-member nogood. `:ground`:
  the mark and the predicate edges from `Q` up to `P`. The decision takes a `:default`

  b a)` with `a` distinct from `b` and `P` in both functors' `genl` closures, whatever the
  arguments are. Members: the two tuples. `:ground`: the mark and the predicate edges up

  is returned like any other pair. `vaelii.ref.believe/decide` gives the verdict `:merge`
  to a symbol pair whose two members are `:monotonic`, since the engine derives `(equals
  a b)` from such a pair."
