  "The belief reference: what a context believes, computed from the world's premises
  alone, one context at a time, with no memo, no region and no budget.

  **The reading is per context.** Belief at `C` is a function of the writes stored in
  `up(C)` and of nothing else. Every step below (derivation, classes, nogoods, decision)
  runs inside the view of `C`, so each context decides its own nogoods from what it sees.

  1. `up(C)`: see `up-with`.
  2. The premises visible at `C`: every write whose storage context (`world/home`) is in
     `up(C)`, minus the sentences `C` has taken OUT.
  3. Derivation: `derive-at`. The rules visible at `C` fire to a fixpoint over the
     believed sentences, stratum by stratum, with `unknown` and `exceptWhen` evaluated
     at `C`. A sentence taken OUT is never re-derived.
  4. Classes: `class-fixpoint`.
  5. Inherited claims: `inherit-at` adds the claims `transitiveInArg` carries down the
     believed `genl` edges, with their classes.
  6. Nogoods: `negation-nogoods` plus every family's output on the view.
  7. Decision: `decide`, then `resolve-at` applies the defeats and repeats from 2.

  A rule antecedent on `p` is met by a fact of any sub-predicate of `p` over the `genl`
  edges believed at `C` (`matches`), so a rule on `animal` fires on `(dog Fido)` once
  `(genl dog animal)` is believed there, and the edges it climbs cap the conclusion.

  The families are passed in (`families`, a seq of functions of a view returning
  nogoods); this namespace requires none of them.

  The view a family receives is `{:context C :sees up(C) :believed #{S …} :class f
  :genl g :inherited #{S …}}`. `:believed` holds every ground literal believed at `C`:
  facts, denials, `genl` and `genlCx` edges and declarations, premises, derivations and
  inherited claims alike. `:inherited` is the subset of `:believed` that no visible write
  states and no rule derives at `C`: the claims only `inherit-at` reaches, which the
  engine stores no sentex for. Rules and `exceptWhen` exceptions are not in `:believed`:
  nothing defeats either, so a rule is believed at `C` exactly when its context is in
  `up(C)`. `(f S)` is the class of `S` at `C`, nil when `S` is not believed. `(g t)` is
  `t` plus every type `t` reaches over the edges the believed `genl` edges and
  `covering` declarations install at `C`.

  A nogood is `{:kind k :members #{S …} :ground #{D …}}`: members believed at `C`, and the
  declarations and edges the clash is read through. The ground takes no part in the
  weighing (docs/nmtms.md, \"What qualifies as a nogood\": a definitional clash's members
  are the clashing sentexes alone, and the declaration and the `genl` closure are read
  through). A declaration is stored `:monotonic` (docs/reference.md D11), and no
  decision reads its class.

  **A relation mark's reach follows belief and not class** (docs/reference.md D7). A
  family reads the sub-predicates a mark convicts off `:genl`, which holds the edges
  believed at `C` and carries no class, and puts the edges of the reach in `:ground`,
  which `decide` never weighs. An edge OUT at `C` carries no mark there, and a
  `:default` edge on the reach leaves the verdict a `:monotonic` edge would give. The
  view had this shape before D7, and D7 changed no code in this namespace.
  `world/check-world` stores a write of a mark, of a declaration and of a predicate `genl`
  edge `:monotonic` whatever it was written at and sets a denial of one aside as inert
  (D10, D11, D17), so every read of one is `:monotonic` and no decision takes one OUT: a
  mark's reach at `C`
  is the stored predicate edges visible at `C`.

  **A verdict does not bind a reader against its own view** (docs/reference.md D3). A
  context below a vantage decides from its own view, and believes what the vantage took
  OUT when it reads a denial or an edge that dissolves the clash. The test
  `a-verdict-does-not-bind-a-context-below-that-reads-the-clash-released` holds the
  smallest world.

  **An exception is asked at every reader** (docs/reference.md D4). `unknown` and
  `exceptWhen` are evaluated against the sentences believed at the reading context `C`,
  and not at the rule's placement context. The test
  `an-unknown-is-asked-at-every-reader-below-the-placement` holds the smallest world."

    cap), the class of each fact it matched, and the class of each sentence supporting a
    `genl` edge it climbed. The informant is out of the cap; its defeasibility is not;
  - a justification whose rule has an `unknown` antecedent or an `exceptWhen` confers
    `:default` whatever the other classes (docs/reference.md D14: the conclusion goes
    OUT when a blocker arrives). The test
    `a-guarded-firing-confers-default-on-monotonic-grounds` holds the smallest world;
  - the class of a sentence is the strongest of its supports.

  A genlCx path caps nothing: every genlCx edge is `:monotonic` (docs/reference.md D1).

  **The class over routes is the widest bottleneck** (docs/reference.md D9). `matches`
  makes each `genl` route a firing climbs its own justification, so a conclusion
  reachable over several routes takes the maximum over routes of the minimum class
  along each route. The test `a-derivation-over-two-genl-routes-takes-the-widest-bottleneck`

(defn- inherit-at
  "`{:believed :class :inherited}` at a context, from the derivation `d`, its classes
  `cls` and the OUT set `out` (docs/reference.md D5; docs/inherit.md).

  With `(transitiveInArg P k genl)` believed, a believed claim `(P … sup …)` and `sub`
  strictly below `sup` over believed `genl` sentences, `(P … sub …)` is believed, with
  the class the widest bottleneck over the routes (D9): the maximum over the routes of
  the minimum of the claim's class and the classes of the route's edges. The
  declaration is `:monotonic` (D7) and caps nothing. Several declarations on one
  position union their reaches.

  The claim is not believed while its denial `(not (P … sub …))` is believed, nor when a
  decision took it OUT. D5 states the block for a denial of class at least the claim's.
  The inherited family (`vaelii.ref.nogoods/inherited`) convicts a weaker denial beside a
  `:monotonic` general claim and route, the denial is its unique weakest member, and the
  next round derives the claim; so at the settled state the two statements agree, and no
  round holds a claim beside its denial as a negation nogood. The class of a sentence a
  write states or a rule derives, and that inheritance also reaches, is the strongest of
  the two; `:inherited` holds only the sentences nothing else supports.

  Readings the docs leave open, and the one taken here:

  - Two preserved positions on one predicate: each step moves one position, and a
    claim a step reaches is a claim the next step moves from, so `(P dog cat)` under
    both positions reaches `(P chi siamese)` through `(P chi cat)` or `(P dog siamese)`.
    docs/inherit.md's `largerThan` example answers such a tuple and does not say how.
    The inherited family reads an inherited claim in `:believed` as a general claim, so
    its nogoods cover the same tuples.
  - A denial of an intermediate tuple, `(not (P … mid …))` with `mid` between `sub` and
    `sup`, does not stop the route to `sub`: D5 names only the denial of the reached
    tuple. docs/inherit.md, \"Specificity\", has a nearer contrary claim undercut a
    `:default` general claim, which this does not model.
  - A `covering` part edge carries no claim; only a stated `genl` sentence does.
  - The declaration is read for `P` itself and never for a sub-predicate of `P`
    (docs/inherit.md states this), so a claim spelled at a sub-predicate moves nothing."
