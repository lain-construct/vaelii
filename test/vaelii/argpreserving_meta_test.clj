  "The argument-type meta-predicates answer along the `genl` closure on the query
  surface, so `ask` agrees with the generalization `check` already walks internally.
  Read literally instead, a stored `(arg petMammal 1 mammal)` is the only thing
  `(ask (arg petMammal 1 animal))` could return — nothing — even though
  `(genl mammal animal)` holds and `check` accepts an animal there, and the two entry points
  disagree about one declaration.

  The engine answers it in `provers/MetaConstraintProver`, a bounded closure walk, and
  NOT by declaring the meta-predicates `transitiveInArg` — that would tax every one of
  the KB's very many `arg`/`genlArg` lookups (see `resources/kb/CxCore.txt`).  The
  predicate position (1) reaches DOWN `genl` (a constraint on a super binds its
  specializations); an unconditional type reaches UP (a stored subtype answers its
  supertypes — `arg`/`genlArg` position 3, `interArg`'s target position 5); and
  `interArg`'s trigger position 3, being an antecedent, is contravariant and reaches
  DOWN.

  The KB here is CxCore alone, so what these tests read is the *shipped* vocabulary
  and not one they stated."
