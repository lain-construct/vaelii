  "A visibility `(except (sentexHandle R))` whose target is a **rule**.

  docs/contexts.md says the removal is total — reads and derivations both.  A firing
  rests on its rule exactly as it rests on its facts (the stored justification
  carries the rule handle among its antecedents), and every arm of the machinery has
  to honor that, including the two whose triggers cannot come for free:

  * **Revival.**  `special/recheck-except` re-chains a rule target on departure,
    because its other arms are keyed on a *fact* target — `dependents` is empty once
    the firing is swept, and the predicate fan never matches a rule sentence — so
    without the rule arm nothing re-derives what the except was hiding.
  * **Backward chaining.**  `provers/candidate-rules` drops a rule the visibility
    hidden set hides from the asking context, so a goal in the cone cannot rebuild
    through a hidden rule what forward chaining sweeps.

  Each test pins one arm: the sweep of an existing firing, the block of a late one,
  the revival on retraction, the backward chainer's candidate filter, and the
  dispute-resolution shape (a justified dispute whose defeated side must vanish from
  every read surface, not only from the argue tree).  House rules as everywhere
  else: gensym'd temporaries via `tu/with-terms`, engine vocabulary literal, the
  neutral fixture asserts the KB is restored."

;; ---- 1. sweeping ---------------------------------------------------------
;; DECISION (contexts.md, "The removal is total"): a late except sweeps what already
;; fired.  The fact arm of this is pinned by the except tests; this pins the rule arm —
;; the conclusion's own handle is never an except target here, so an empty read below
;; can only mean belief actually moved, not that a read filter hid it.

;; ---- 5. dispute resolution -----------------------------------------------

;; opposite literals — the engine represents it rather than deciding it), then a
;; visibility except lands on one side's *rule*.  Defeat must land on support, and
;; once it does, every read surface has to agree: the defeated conclusion is gone,
;; the survivor stands, and the contradiction is resolved — not just the argue tree,
;; but belief, the stored matches, and the conflict roster.
