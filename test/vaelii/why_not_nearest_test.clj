  "`why-not`'s `{:nearest n}`: which rule nearly fired, and what it was still waiting for.

  `:not-stored` is the emptiest answer the entry point has — no handle, no support, no defeat —
  and it is the one a reader whose rule was *supposed* to conclude the goal gets.  What
  they need next is the antecedent they have not asserted, and these tests are about
  getting that named.

  Two contracts beside the answer itself.  The search is **off unless asked for**, since
  `why-not` is called in a loop over a conflict list and a backward search per call would
  change what the entry point costs.  And the ranking keys on **content** — how many antecedents
  are satisfied, then the rule's own sentence — never on the rule's handle, which is
  assertion order."
