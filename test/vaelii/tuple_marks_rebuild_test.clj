  "A rebuild reads each functor's tuple marks once.

  `rebuild-candidates!` offers every stored tuple to `note-tuple!`, which reads the
  `functional`, `functionalInArg` and `anti_transitive` marks on the tuple's functor and
  above it (`tuple/det-marks`, `tax/props-over`), each a walk of the functor's
  supertypes.  The replay holds the taxonomy still, so it keeps each functor's marks
  (`tuple/*functor-marks*`): on a large KB's recover the walk per tuple rebuilt the same
  few thousand closures millions of times.  The determinants and chains it finds must be
  the ones a rebuild reading the marks per tuple finds."
