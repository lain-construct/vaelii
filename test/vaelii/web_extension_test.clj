  "The browser's extension registry, driven through the public `vaelii.web` shim as an
  outside library would drive it: what a registered extension adds to every page, which
  guard each route method carries, and what the registry refuses at registration.

  Every test registers under a name of its own and unregisters in a `finally`, so the
  registry is empty again when the test ends — the registry is process state, and a
  leaked extension would add a panel to every term page another namespace renders."
