  "Order independence over a **mixed** KB, on every storage backend.

  The per-subsystem shuffle tests each hold one mechanism still and permute the rest:
  `aggregate_test` the aggregates, `equality_test` the partition, `inherit_forward_test`
  the genl seeding, `constraint_nogood_test` the nogoods, `canonical_vars_test` the
  variable canonicalization, `asp_edge_test` the solver. `property_test` generates
  scenarios rather than writing them, but from one pool in one context.

  A mixed KB is where the mechanisms meet, and the meeting is the part no per-subsystem
  shuffle sees. So the pool here spans them at once: ground facts in three contexts
  joined by `genlCx` edges, a four-link `genl` chain, a defeasible rule and a monotonic
  one, a rule with a negated antecedent, a rule carrying its own `exceptWhen`, a `sameAs`
  edge above one of the context edges and two `equals` edges — one beside the fact it
  displaces, one on the type a rule fires on — and two chains that end where they began.
  A drawn subset routinely puts a taxonomy edge, an equality merge, an exception and a
  retraction into one KB, and the question is whether the arrival order of those decides
  anything.

  **The declarations that reach back are in the pool too**, because each is a mark whose
  arrival order is the whole question and none of them was drawn here before:

  - a rule guarded by `(different ?a ?b)`, which is negation as failure over the equality
    closure and over the `indeterminate_term` category and so names no handle a
    justification can carry — its two arguments are a pair one of the pool's own `equals`
    edges merges, and the category reaches it twice more, by a direct membership and by a
    kind declared under it;
  - `(functionalInArg keeperOf 1)` over a `(genl ownerOf keeperOf)` edge, so the mark, the
    edge and two facts are four ingredients of one merge and every arrival order runs a
    different retroactive arm;
  - `(symmetric walksWith)` over a pair **both** of whose spellings a rule concluded,
    which is the fold that has no bare premise to take;
  - `(predSpecifiedAll keeperOf dog)` over an `(arg keeperOf 1 person)` slot contract, an
    integrity audit that stores nothing and reads the believed extents, the elected
    spelling and the category at once.

  **What is compared, and why it is content.** Three readings, all handle-free:

  - the believed sentences **per assertion context**, and per **view** context up the
    `genlCx` ancestor set (which is where the exception force and the visibility gate land);
  - the belief label of each believed sentex — `defeat-class`, plus the contradiction
    and conflict tallies, so a flipped class or a double-counted dilemma surfaces;
  - the `genl` / `genlCx` closures at every probe type and context, plus the equality
    partition they are cached beside, the `different` answer over five probe pairs, and
    the integrity audit's violation set.

  `different` is read directly as well as through the conclusion it guards, and the reason
  is what makes it need the re-check index at all: it holds by the *absence* of a merge,
  so a firing it withdrew leaves nothing in the sentence sets to say why.

  Which sentexes are **stored** is deliberately absent, for `property_test`'s reason: a
  conclusion drawn and then defeated leaves a record an ordering that defeated its
  antecedent first never wrote, and both orderings read the same belief off different
  record sets. A stored sentex is not a believed one.

  **Every backend, one JVM.** `scripts/test-backends.sh` runs the whole suite on each of
  the eight, which is the thorough gate and a thing somebody has to remember; this
  opens all eight itself, so an order-dependence that only appears under the durable
  index fails in an ordinary `lein test`. The KBs are private — their own spaces, and a
  private temp directory per durable arm — so they share a store with nothing.

  **Two runs of one property, and the difference is the seed.** The `:default` sweep
  fixes it and draws small scenarios, so a red is reproducible from the failure alone.
  The `^:slow` run takes three fixed seeds and draws the whole pool. Both assert one
  `is` per backend (per seed, in the slow one) whatever they find, so the assertion
  count is a property of the file rather than of the box."

  exception becomes `(exceptWhen <query> (sentexHandle H))` beside it. So the stored
  sentence carries an allocation order *inside its own content*, and two orderings that
