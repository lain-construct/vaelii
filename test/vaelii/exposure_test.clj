  "Two memberships each admissible where stated, whose types some context can jointly
  see as disjoint, are a real contradiction.  Every reader that sees the pair whole
  decides it, and no writer is refused on grounds it cannot see.

  Three routes bring one clash into joint sight — the membership arriving last, the
  separating declaration arriving last, the `genlCx` edge arriving last — and the answer
  is route-agnostic.  Each route gets a test; the shared lattice is two siblings under
  CxUniverse, with the joint viewer (when one exists) below both.  The membership-last
  route's acceptance test is
  `disjoint_test/a-general-context-may-be-given-what-a-specific-one-forbids`.

  **A separation derivable only below the members' maximal common descendant is decided
  too**: the context under it that reads the whole clash decides it
  (`chain/place-memberships!`), so `deep-separation!`'s lattice is decided where the separation
  comes into view.  The settle files no `:disjoint` ledger entry, and `exposed-clashes`
  answers the standing question of every jointly-visible pair, decided or not."

;; ---- and the edge that carries the mark rather than the view -------------
;;
;; A mark is read up the predicate hierarchy (`tax/props-over`), so a pair of `fatherOf`
;; facts either side of a visibility edge is a `(functional parentOf)` clash — and the
;; region walk finds it by itself, because `declared?` asks the same descending question.
;; What the region cannot supply is the pair whose `(genl fatherOf parentOf)` edge arrives
;; **last**: a predicate edge relabels neither half, so neither half is in the region, and
;; the edge is a binary sentence whose own functor carries no mark, so it is a candidate
;; for nothing.  Only naming it a trigger reaches them.  Same shape as the `genlCx` case
;; above and the same answer — the disjointness pass has the analogous arm, over the
;; memberships an edge newly separates.
