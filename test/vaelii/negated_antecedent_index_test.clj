  "A negated antecedent `(not (p ?x))` files under `[:not p]` in the antecedent index
  (`rules/antecedent-key`), and a negative datum triggers through that one key
  (`rules/trigger-keys`): an arriving `(not (p a))` reaches the rules negated on `p`
  rather than every rule with a negated antecedent anywhere.  Both sides spell the key
  the same way, the rebuilt index spells it the same way, and the firing, its
  retraction and its arrival-order independence are what the spelling has to keep."
