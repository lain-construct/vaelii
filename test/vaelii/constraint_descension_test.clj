  "A constraint declared of a predicate binds the tuples of every predicate beneath it.

  `(genl fatherOf parentOf)` says every `fatherOf` tuple **is** a `parentOf` tuple, and a
  tuple set only narrows going down — so `(arg parentOf 1 person)` is a claim about
  `fatherOf`'s first argument too.  Reading a declaration off the exact functor made the
  refusal *entry-point-dependent*: the ill-typed claim was refused under the general spelling,
  admitted under the specialized one, and then answered every general-spelling query
  through the matcher's own fan.  Every test here is a pair of entry points that must agree.

  The line this must not cross is the other direction: a **generative** property —
  `transitiveInArg`, `transitive`, `symmetric`, `reflexive` — is a claim about a relation
  and stays with the predicate that carries it.  Refusal-side constraints descend
  because tuples narrow; licences generate tuples and do not.  `inherit-test`'s
  `the-licence-stays-with-the-predicate-it-names` and `provers-test`'s
  `the-walk-reads-hops-through-the-subsumption-fan` pin that, and nothing here may move
  them."

;; declarations *refuse* tuples, and a sub-predicate's tuples are the super's, so a
;; refusal above is a refusal below.  `transitive`, `symmetric`, `reflexive` and
;; `transitiveInArg` *license* tuples, and a licence read for a predicate nobody declared
;; it of manufactures knowledge — dogs may be larger than cats without every subkind
;; being much larger.  So the generative four stay exactly where they were stated.
;;
;; `transitiveInArg` is pinned by `inherit-test`'s `the-licence-stays-with-the-predicate-
;; it-names` and `transitive` by `provers-test`'s `the-walk-reads-hops-through-the-
;; subsumption-fan`.  The other two are here, because a property that quietly began to
