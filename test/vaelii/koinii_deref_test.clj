  "Koinii cross-seat dereference: independent seats, each holding its own KB,
  kept in sync by content-addressed commits.  A locator is a hash over a sentex's
  canonical identity, so two seats holding the same assertion compute the same one; a
  commit id is a hash over a seat's whole locator set, so it is a function of state; and a
  marker is untrusted — a seat resolves it against its OWN KB and rehashes what it finds.

  One deftest per 'How to verify' bullet: two seats resolving one commit's sentence to the
  byte-identical canonical form and the same provenance, byte-stable export, tamper caught
  — plus the locator and commit-id invariants the design rests on.  The seats are separate
  KBs (memory on distinct spaces, and a genuinely disk-backed one for the git case)."
