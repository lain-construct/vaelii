  "Argument-position preservation: `(transitiveInArg P n R)` /
  `(transitiveInArgInverse P n R)`, the specificity that lets a stated claim override an
  inherited one, and the `(asymmetric P)` conflict that a strict claim raises instead.

  The running example is the one that makes the semantics necessary: `(largerThan dog
  cat)` reaches a golden retriever and a maine coon, and it also reaches a *chihuahua*
  and a maine coon, where it is false.  Which of those two the KB gets is decided by
  how the general claim was asserted, not by the vocabulary — known-true content is a
  fixed background that a contrary specific claim contradicts, a default is a
  generality a specific claim is entitled to override."
