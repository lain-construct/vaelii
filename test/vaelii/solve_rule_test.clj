  "`set/solveRule` — a normal rule (`h :- b`) inside a solve, beside the choices
  `set/assumptionRule` offers.  A choice says what a solve may pick; a solve rule says what
  follows in the answer set from what was picked, and a constraint may then name that.

  The problems here need both:

    * **set cover** — pick sets (a choice), derive which elements are covered (a solve
      rule), and require every element covered (a hard constraint over the derived atom);
    * **reachability** — pick edges (a choice), derive what the root reaches (a recursive
      solve rule), and require every node reached.  A cycle of picked edges the root
      cannot reach supports none of its own atoms: the solver's unfounded-set reading,
      which a completion-only encoding lacks;
    * **a rule true in base too** — a bare `set/solveRule` answers backward goals over
      what `Base` believes and derives the same head inside each answer set.

  The record and wrapper tests need no backend; the solves are guarded on `asp?`."
