  "Persistence/recovery: rebuild the in-memory taxonomy and JTMS from the durable
  stores, and atomicity of a rejected assert.

  This file's subject IS the durable store, and it deliberately restarts a second
  KB over the same databases, so teardown is a clear rather than JTMS retraction.
  The fixture still guards net-neutrality: it clears at both ends and asserts the
  store is empty on the way out."
