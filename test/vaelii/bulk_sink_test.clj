  "`protocols/BulkLoading` — the protocol an `import!` writes its records through, so a store
  with an ingest path faster than a record at a time can use it.

  The engine's own stores do not implement it: a `put-sentex` on the RAM and disk
  backends is already a map assoc or a batched WAL append, and there is nothing a bulk
  path could save.  So the capability is tested here against a **wrapper that defers every
  write to its `close`**, which is what makes the two properties that matter provable
  without a database in the room:

  - **the KB is the same one.**  The same dump, imported into a store that bulk-loads and
    one that does not, in all three `:belief?` modes — compared as knowledge, not as calls;
  - **nothing is read back before the close.**  A sink owns its buffer until then, so a
    loader that fetched a record it had just written would see a hole.  The wrapper's
    `get-sentex` **throws** on a handle still buffered, which turns that contract from a
    docstring into a failing test.

  A store with no capability is the third property and the default one: the sink is
  `put-sentex` per record and the premise mark the caller would have made, which is the
  loop the import paths ran before this protocol was in the world."
