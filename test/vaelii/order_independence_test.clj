  "The engine-wide invariant: **the same knowledge, given in any order, yields the
  same beliefs.**

  This is not a nice-to-have. A common-sense KB learns generalities and specifics in
  whatever order the world supplies them — 'birds fly' before or after 'Tweety is a
  penguin' — and an engine whose answers depend on that order is answering a
  question nobody asked.

  These tests enumerate *every* permutation of a scenario's assertions and demand a
  single distinct outcome. They are the regression net for the region-local
  relabelling in `vaelii.impl.jtms`: a local fixpoint is only legitimate because it
  agrees with the global one, and disagreement shows up here as an order-dependent
  answer.

  Note what a weaker test would have missed. The Nixon-diamond case once asserted
  only that *exactly one* side won — which is true under every order even when the
  winner flips. It passed while the engine was order-dependent, because the tie-break
  keyed on handle id and handles are allocated in assertion order (see
  `vaelii.impl.solve/content-key`). Demanding the *identical reading* every time is
  what catches that, and it is why `observe` returns a map compared as a whole rather
  than a boolean per ordering.

  The Nixon diamond has no winner to be stable about: two rules concluding `P` and
  `¬P` with neither naming the other's case is a **represented dilemma**, so both
  sides stay believed and the pair is reported by `contradictions`
  (docs/exceptions.md, \"What surfaces where\"). The expected outcome is therefore
  \"both always coexist, and exactly one dilemma is always reported\" rather than
  \"the same one side always wins\". The dilemma count is in
  `observe` deliberately: a report that appeared under some orderings and not others,
  or that double-counted a pair, is precisely the order-dependence this file exists to
  catch, and it would be invisible to a belief-only reading."

  them changes it.  It does not prove the reading needs all N.  An op that moves no field
  of the reading — a taxonomy edge the conclusion is reached without, a fact the outcome
  never mentions — passes `one-outcome!`, and a KB that never received that op reads the
  same, so the scenario does not test the op's presence at all.  This runs each N-1 subset
  (the ops in their given order, one dropped) and fails naming any op whose removal
  reproduces the outcome.

  The reading is what decides necessity, so a reproduced outcome is a reason to enrich the
  `observe` before it is a reason to drop the op: a field that separates the op's own
  mechanism from an outcome reached another way makes the op necessary and the test
  stronger.  Flat ops only — ops that constrain one another, a `retract!` on the handle its
  own `assert` allocated, cannot drop independently and belong with the confluence tests
  below.

  The necessity leg drops each op from its given-order position and runs that N-1 subset
  once, so a *pass* is conclusive (a globally-redundant op reproduces the outcome in the
  given order too, and is caught) but a *redundant verdict* is given-order-only: an op the
  check flags could still be necessary under some other order, if the N-1 subset is itself
  order-dependent.  So a flag is a reason to enrich or to confirm all-order inertness

  "Every row of `trigger-rows` over every ordering, or over `cap` of them.  The trigger's
  type is read when the fact or the declaration arrives, so a trigger arriving last

  names the trigger so that retracting any part of it withdraws the derivation.  The
  types' edges to `thing` are an op of their own, so the declared type becoming mintable
  last is among the orders.

  retracting it leaves the KB that never had it: the `except` moving reaches the
