  "Completeness is a claim about a **goal**, not about a predicate.

  `solve-goal-with` runs the cheapest complete prover *alone*, which is most of what
  makes `ask` cheap on a closure goal — and it is only sound if `completeness 100`
  means *my answers are a superset of everyone else's for this goal*.  A computed
  prover normally earns that: the closures are built from the very facts `FactProver`
  would return, and a calculus reads both the facts and the derived conclusions into
  its network before entailing anything.

  What none of them can read is a claim nobody stored.  `(argPreserving P n R)`
  licenses a statement about a tuple that appears in no fact, no rule conclusion and no
  network — so a prover that claimed 100 unconditionally would discard it silently,
  and `query-plan` would list a prover that never runs.

  Three channels reach a goal that way, each found by differencing — run the complete
  prover alone, run everyone else applicable, and see what only the second answers.
  Two of them were live `ask` / `prove` disagreements: a `set/backwardRule` concluding
  `genl`, `disjoint` or an RCC-8 predicate never fires forward, so its conclusion is in
  no closure and no network; and a declared `(inverse P Q)` stores the claim under a
  name neither the closures nor a calculus vocabulary reads.

  These tests are the two halves of that: the claim survives, and the diagnostic says
  which provers actually ran."
