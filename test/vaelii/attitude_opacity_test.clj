  "Attitude opacity — docs/belief.md, docs/equality.md.

  A `modal_predicate`'s proposition is a **mention**: what the *agent* holds true, named
  as syntax.  From *Oedipus believes he married Jocasta* and *Jocasta is his mother* it
  does not follow that he believes he married his mother, so an identity merge the asker
  can see must not rewrite a term inside `(believes Oedipus …)`.  The merge the *agent*
  holds does license it, and licenses it for that agent alone.

  Two halves, and they are separate mechanisms.  The **barrier** is congruence opacity in
  `res/representative-term`, which every read door and every migration goes through — so
  the question and the stored belief hold still together, and neither can retrieve what
  the other renamed.  The **licence** is `BeliefProjectionProver`, which normalizes the
  projected proposition against the agent's own partition, the ordinary rule that the
  reader is what elects, applied to the reader a projection actually has.

  The agent slot is *not* part of the quotation: it is a term the asker refers with, so
  merging two names for one agent is one agent under two names.  Nor is a non-sentence
  argument one, nor a predicate nobody granted the marker to."
