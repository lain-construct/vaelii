  "Forward chaining on a relation nobody stored.

  A forward rule's antecedents are matched against stored facts, and an *entailed*
  qualitative relation has no handle to match — so on its own it fires nothing, and a
  justification with no antecedent would be a conclusion nothing can withdraw.  Support
  closes that: an entailment names the stored facts it rests on, and those become the
  firing's antecedents.

  So these tests are about three things and not really about deriving at all: that the
  conclusion *arrives*, that `why` names the facts behind it, and that retracting any one
  of them takes it away again."
