  "What one assert costs the index, as **counted operations** — the gate for the class of
  regression `lein perf` is structurally blind to.

  `bench/vaelii/bench/perf.clj` asserts a ratio and never a millisecond, which is what
  makes it survive a loaded laptop.  The price of that is stated in its own preamble: **a
  ratio cannot see a constant.**  An unconditional read added to the assert path moves the
  reading at both sizes by the same amount and divides out, so every one of its checks
  passes untouched.  One regression has already shipped through that gap —
  `inter-args-problem` ran its `interArg` declaration retrieval unconditionally, on
  every assert of every KB, and nothing declares `interArg` — ~11% per assert of a
  declaration-carrying predicate.  It was found by hand, against a worktree at the
  parent commit.

  This gate closes that gap from the other side.  It runs seventeen fixed workloads with
  `vaelii.impl.profile` collecting and pins the **exact** index-operation counts each one
  costs: every `IndexStore` read by family, every `index-sentex` batch op by family, and
  every `unindex-sentex!` batch op by family.  Twelve of the seventeen assert and five retract,
  so a constant added to either write path lands here.

  **Eight of the twelve write a fact and four write the vocabulary**, which is the split to
  read the assert half by.  A check that grows costs a fact nothing and a `genl` edge or
  an `(arity P n)` everything: a binding or an edge recomputes the arity candidates of the
  functors below it (`decide/note-candidate!`) off the candidate index, and the
  argument-type entailment reads what an edge newly puts above the facts.
  `:taxonomy-edge` and `:arity-declaration` are the two that price that path.

  ## Why a count and not a duration

  The quantity is an integer the engine computes, not a measurement of the machine, so
  there is no warm-up, no tail mean, no noise floor and no tolerance.  It is bit-identical
  across runs, across machines and across a loaded box — which is the standing complaint
  against the ratio gate and the reason this one can live in the suite rather than behind
  a command somebody has to remember.  It costs a few seconds.

  It is also *more sensitive than a duration in the region that matters*.  The regression
  above is one read against the plain workload's twenty-five per assert — 4% of its total
  reads, which no wall-clock gate would separate from noise — and 20% of the five
  `:argument-root` reads it lands beside, which this one fails on.  Counting per family
  is what buys that: a constant hides in a total and stands out in the family it lands
  on.

  ## Why exact, and not a ceiling

  A ceiling would let a change spend anything already budgeted, and the budget is not a
  design target — it is a record of what the engine does today.  Exact equality means any
  movement, in either direction, is a diff somebody has to look at and either explain or
  fix, and the number that lands beside the explanation is the change's own cost.  That is
  the whole product: an index change proposing a new family becomes a line saying how many
  operations per assert it added.

  So a legitimate optimization **fails this gate**, and that is correct.  Re-pin the
  number, and the commit that does so carries the improvement as data.

  ## What it does not catch

  - **Work that is not an index operation.**  Computation, allocation, a record-store
    read, a taxonomy walk.  The counted calls are `IndexStore`'s, so a constant added between two
    of them is invisible here.
  - **A more expensive version of the same operation.**  One `sentexes-with-arg` counts
    once whether it returns four handles or four million.  `lein perf`'s
    `intersect-selectivity` is the check that holds *that*, and this gate does not
    subsume it.
  - **A retraction cost read as a per-retraction constant.**  `unindex-sentex!` reports
    what it cost (`:retracts`, docs/profile.md), so a teardown is budgeted the same way —
    except `:dead`, the trie nodes a removal emptied, which is decided by what else is
    still stored under the same prefix rather than by the sentex.  It is exact for a
    fixed corpus torn down in a fixed order, which is what a workload is, and it is not a
    figure another corpus reproduces.  So a moved `:dead` is read against the workload
    that produced it: change `n` or the structure of the facts and it moves for that reason
    alone, where every other family scales with `n`.
  - **A durable index.**  Every workload runs twice, on `:memory` and on
    `:memory-columnar` — the KV index and the columnar trie — and one budget holds both:
    the columnar store tallies its trie families under `KvIndexStore`'s labels and
    delegates the other families to an embedded `KvIndexStore`.  `:fan`, the node-probe
    count only `KvIndexStore`'s walk keeps, is in no budget.  The durable backends are not
    run: the KB is pinned rather than inherited from `scripts/test-backends.sh`, so the
    gate says the same thing on all eight backend runs rather than eight different things.
  - **A configuration other than the shipped one.**  `with-shipped-retrieval` pins every
    switch that decides which family answers a read (`tu/shipped-defaults`), so the
    budgets are a claim about the defaults and about nothing else.  The reference retrieval path
    (`VAELII_HIER=0`) really does cost differently — two reads per sentex off
    `:argument-root` and onto `:trie-lookup` — and it carries no budget here.
  - **Anything that scales.**  A cost that grows with the KB is `lein perf`'s subject and
    it is a ratio for good reason.  The two gates are complements: that one holds the
    *shape*, this one holds the *constant*, and neither sees the other's regressions."

;; on the declaration functors' predicate extents, which every shipped index store answers from
;; memory.
;;
;; **Four `:predicate-extent` reads per scoped `genl` read are the taxonomy's census.**  A
;; scoped `genls` or `genl?` reads which contexts state a `genl`, `covering`, `separating`
;; or `partition` fact, one count read per functor (`tax/visible-ctxs`), and nothing holds
;; the answer between reads.  A membership asks one scoped read and a declared argument
;; four.
;;
;; **`:argument-root` and `:argument-slot` carry the small-side lead (`res/*lead-side*
;; :auto`), which is why they read near-equal.**  A scoped clash retrieval leads from the
;; term's own postings — the count, one `:argument-slot` read of the slot roster, and one
;; `:argument-root` node read per roster predicate in the closure — rather than one
;; predicate-scoped `:argument-root` bucket per sub-predicate, whenever the term is the
;; smaller side.  A roster holding no predicate of the closure reads no node.  That trades per-spec `:argument-root` reads for `:argument-
;; slot` ones and keeps a deep hierarchy's closure walk at O(term); these workloads are
;; deliberately shallow, so the closure is nothing to collapse and what lands here is the
;; small constant the trade costs — carried as data, per the "a legitimate optimization
;; fails this gate" rule above.  `matches_hierarchical_test` holds the set the three lead
;; sides must agree on and `lead_side_cost_test` holds the shape (`:auto` flat in the
;; hierarchy width, the scoped lead not) — the win this constant buys, so a re-pin here
;; cannot hide its regression.
;;
;; **One `:opposed` read per settle is the negation placement's gate**: the count of the
;; bodies stored in both polarities (`reads/stores-opposed?`, `chain/place-nogoods!`).  The
;; index write reads a fact's `[:false B]` count itself, untallied, to post the opposed
;; family (`kv/opposed-adds`), so `:trie-counts` holds no read per fact written for the
;; negation family.  No workload here stores a body in both polarities, so no family's
;; writes moved.
;;
;; **One `:predicate-extent` read per settle is the related-types gate**: whether a fact of
;; `orthogonal` or of a predicate under it is stored (`related/orthogonals?`), which a
;; separation declaration the settle relabels can contradict.  A settle after a `genl` edge
;; moved reads the `disjoint` and `orthogonal` counts again (`related/sync-related`), which
;; is the +2 a KB's first settle reads and `taxonomy-edge` reads per assert.
;;
;; **`:slots` counts the slot rosters' ops and the shape roster's together.**  A positive
;; fact writes two shape ops, its length into its functor's lengths and its shape's count
;; up (`kv/shape-adds`); a retraction writes one, or two when it is its shape's last fact
;; (`kv/shape-retires`).  A binding or an edge that recomputes the arity candidates reads
;; a functor's lengths once, as one `:predicate-extent` read.
;;
;; **`:roots` counts the root postings and the count-trie node ops together.**  A binary
;; fact writes its context root, its predicate-extent leaf and one argument leaf per
;; argument, and the predicate extent's node and each argument's node take a child edge
;; and a count: ten ops, six of them the nodes'.  A retraction that empties a node deletes
;; its count and its child edge; one that leaves the node standing decrements the count
;; alone, which is why the bystander teardowns read 802 rather than 1,000.  A ground
;; binary self tuple `(p a a)` also enters the self-tuple trie, its leaf, child edge and
;; count: three ops, which `declared`'s `(acDecl x x)` facts pay.
;;
;; **One `:mint` read per settle pass**, in every workload: the mint withdrawal's gate
;; reads the mint family's count (`reads/stored-mint-count`).  No record these settles move
;; can subsume a mint, so nothing else reads the family, `declared`'s filed mints included.
;; `nat-orphan-teardown` settles twice per retraction.

  A budget is a claim about one configuration, and these are the vars that change which

  which routes context-scoped matching through the reference nested fan-out instead of the
  set-algebra path: measured here, that moves two reads per sentex off `:argument-root`
  and onto `:trie-lookup` — the trade the two paths exist to make, and a budget written for
  one of them is simply false about the other.  Pinning is the same argument that pins the
  backend, and it is preferred to standing aside, since a gate that skips under a sweep is
  a gate that is not running on the configuration somebody is currently changing.

  The set is `tu/shipped-defaults` rather than a list of vars named here, and the
  difference is which switches a local list omits without anybody noticing.
  `chain/*matcher*` is the standing example: it is reached from `join-matches` and

;; The read budgets above pin what an *incremental* assert costs, and `rule-fired`'s
;; `:predicate-extent`/`:trie-lookup` are the pre-optimization numbers precisely because a
;; one-fact run does not arm the forward-chain authority memo
;; (`kb/chain-authority-min-frontier`).  This is the other half of that claim, and it is a
;; shape rather than a constant — the way `lein perf` holds a ratio the exact budgets
;; cannot.  Over a **bulk** frontier the memo *is* armed, and its whole purpose — skipping
;; `find-sentex-handle`'s novelty trie-walk for a functor the store never held — shows up
;; as a `:trie-lookup` count that does **not** grow with the conclusions.  Both halves are
;; a standing regression risk: a change that stops arming the memo silently loses the skip
;; (and `:trie-lookup` goes back to O(conclusions) on every bulk load), and one that arms
;; it for every run silently puts the probe back on the incremental assert path that
;; `rule-fired` guards.
