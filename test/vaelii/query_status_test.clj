  "`query-status` — `query`'s answers plus a report of the run.

  The report exists for one silent failure `:max-depth` otherwise has: a query truncated
  at the depth bound returns the same empty (or short) seq as a query whose goal is
  genuinely unprovable, so a bound one too low reads as \"no\" rather than \"not deep
  enough.\"  The tests below hold the distinction — a too-shallow bound is `:truncated?`
  where an unprovable goal at a sufficient bound is not — and check the timings and the
  context refusal that come with it.

  `:truncated?` is conservative: it fires when the bound stopped any rewrite, which for a
  cyclic rule set is every bound (the search always has one deeper level to refuse), and
  which for a fixed-depth rule chain clears exactly when the bound is deep enough.  Both
  are asserted; the fixed-depth case is the empire-eligibility shape the prompt names."

;; A fixed-depth rule chain, the empire-eligibility shape: `eligible` wraps `canAct`,
