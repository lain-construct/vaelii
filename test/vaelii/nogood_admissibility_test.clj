  "Which handles a nogood may name, and why the answer differs per source.

  A nogood is a set the settle may resolve by **defeating a member**, so admission to
  the set is a stronger question than incompatibility: a nogood must stay derivable
  exactly as long as what it convicts stands (docs/nmtms.md, *What qualifies as a
  nogood*).  The failure it is drawn from is a member the conviction is read *through* —
  defeat that and the clash becomes undetectable while the content it convicted goes on
  standing, so it is decided once and re-derived by nobody.

  The criterion is only a runtime property in one place: **which handles a source puts
  in `:nogood`**.  So that is what this pins, for all three shipped sources, together
  with the consequence that makes it worth pinning — that acting on a definitional clash
  leaves the vocabulary that convicted it believed, and therefore leaves the verdict
  stable across the settles that follow.

  The three answers are deliberately not the same, which is why a test that assumed one
  rule for all three would be wrong:

  * a **rebuttal** names the two claims;
  * a **definitional clash** names the clashing sentexes and *not* the declaration,
    which is vocabulary read through;
  * an **inherited clash** names the stored claim *and its reasons*, because the claim
    it convicts has no sentex of its own for a defeat to reach instead.

  `constraint_nogood_test` and `inherited_clash_test` own the behaviour of each source;
  this namespace owns the one property that spans them."
