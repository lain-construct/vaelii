  "`kb-diff`: what two KBs disagree about, as content.

  The claim that makes it worth having is the one about **handles**.  Two KBs holding
  identical knowledge share not a single handle — handles are allocated in assertion
  order, so a reload renumbers everything — and a diff keyed on one would report a KB
  loaded from its own export as wholly changed.  The round-trip test here is that claim:
  export a KB as text, load it back into a second KB, and the two diff empty.

  The four buckets are then the four ways two KBs can differ about one sentence: it is
  new, it is gone, it holds in a different context, or it is stored in both and believed
  in only one.  A defeated default is the last of those, and it is the one a comparison
  of stored records alone would miss entirely."
