  "The two ways of finding the claims that bear on a preservation goal answer the same
  set.

  A claim bearing on `(P a b)` is a stored sentence whose argument tuple lies in the
  **product** of the preserved arguments' reaches.  There are two ways to intersect a
  product with a store: enumerate the product and probe each tuple, or read the
  predicate's extent and keep the tuples that land in the product.  `inherit`
  (`*retrieval* :auto`) picks per goal by weighing one against the other, so on any
  given KB only one of them runs — and a divergence would be a silently different
  *answer*, not a crash.

  So this pins them against each other directly, on randomized KBs, comparing the raw
  claim set rather than the verdict: a future change to `undercut?` or `verdict` could
  hide a retrieval difference behind an unchanged yes/no, and the set is what those
  read.  The shapes are the ones the two paths could disagree on — several claims at
  once, mixed polarity, a negated claim, an asymmetric predicate's converse, claims at
  and off the product's edge, subsumption through a sub-predicate, and a symmetric
  predicate whose mirror can hand a match back in the other argument order."
