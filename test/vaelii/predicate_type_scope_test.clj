  "A property mark like `(transitive P)` is the queryable classification itself — there is
  no derived `…Predicate` twin and no prover reading a global roster.  So asking
  `(transitive P)` is ordinary context-scoped retrieval, and it agrees with the
  `has-prop?`, `isa?` and stored-sentex reads beside it from every vantage.  A permuting
  mark's property is the exception: it decides the key a sentex is stored under in every
  context, so `has-prop?` reads it where the store does (docs/contexts.md).

  The shipped ontology **masks** the scoping: `symmetric`/`transitive`/`reflexive`/
  `functional` are `decontextualized_predicate`s (CxCore), so a real KB lifts every such
  mark into CxUniverse and every context sees it — global and scoped agree.  So this pins
  the scoping on a **bare** KB, where the mark stays in the context it was declared in and
  a sibling cannot see it; `meta_test` is the companion that pins the lifted, shipped
  behaviour.

  Each test builds its own KB on the **isolated** database pair: it rebuilds in a loop,
  which would clear the shared pair out from under another namespace's `:once` fixture."
