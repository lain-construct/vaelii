  "Per-namespace assertion counts, for a suite total that moves between runs.

  `scripts/test-backends.sh` checks that every configuration ran the same number of
  assertions, because a run that quietly skipped something is indistinguishable from a green run.  When
  that check fails the next question is always *which namespace*, and the suite's own
  output cannot answer it: `lein test` prints one total for 297 namespaces.

  Bisecting the total is the obvious move and it is the wrong one.  A namespace list
  passed to `lein test` is not the set `lein test :default` discovers (304 files against
  297 namespaces here), and naming namespaces explicitly changes the order they run in —
  so a search over subsets can report a difference the whole suite does not have, or miss
  one it does.  Both happen.  Counting per namespace inside **one ordinary run** avoids
  the question entirely: same discovery, same order, same fixtures.

  Off unless `VAELII_TEST_NS_COUNTS` is true, and it changes nothing when on — the counts
  are read from `clojure.test`'s own counters, which are already being maintained.

      VAELII_TEST_NS_COUNTS=1 lein test :default 2>&1 | grep NSCOUNT > a.txt
      VAELII_TEST_NS_COUNTS=1 lein test :default 2>&1 | grep NSCOUNT > b.txt
      diff a.txt b.txt          # the namespace whose count moved

  One line per namespace, tab-separated, prefixed `NSCOUNT` so it survives a grep out of
  a log that is otherwise full of ticks and timings.

  `VAELII_TEST_VERDICTS` installs the per-test counterpart, `install-verdicts!`: one
  `TESTVERDICT` line per test var, which `lein test-red` inverts (scripts/test-selector.sh)."
