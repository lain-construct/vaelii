  "Shared test scaffolding that keeps every test **net-neutral** to KB content.

  A test must leave the KB exactly as it found it.  Two mechanisms enforce that:

    * gensym'd temporary terms — a test that asserts invents its individuals,
      predicates, types, and contexts with `tmp-ind` / `tmp-pred` / `tmp-type` /
      `tmp-ctx`, so its content is provably disjoint from any baseline ontology
      and can never collide with a real term.
    * the neutral fixtures — after each test the fixture retracts everything the
      test added (dependency-directed, so derived consequences fall away too) and
      then asserts the live sentex/justification/premise sets are back to their
      baseline.  The assertion is a genuine invariant: it fails only when retraction
      leaves residue, i.e. a real teardown gap.

  Fixture recipes:

    ;; a shared KB loaded once (starter / CxCore), neutral per test
    (use-fixtures :once (tu/loaded tu/load-starter!))
    (use-fixtures :each (tu/neutral))

    ;; a fresh KB rebuilt per test (empty or CxCore-loaded), neutral per test
    (use-fixtures :each (tu/neutral-fresh tu/fresh))

    ;; an inline KB inside one deftest (varied baselines in one file)

;; ---- the switches, and the pin that hands their defaults back -----------
;;
;; Every switch below installs its implementation by ALTERING A ROOT: a replacement no
;; `binding` sees and no test undoes, which is exactly what a whole-suite sweep wants,
;; since the claim it tests is that the alternative answers identically.
;;
;; A **counted** gate wants the opposite.  A budget or a cost shape is a claim about one
;; configuration, so `assert_cost_test`, `lead_side_cost_test` and `join_lead_cost_test`
;; have to measure the shipped reader whichever sweep is running.  `chain/join-matches` is
;; the sharp edge: it takes its argument lead only under the reference matcher, so a gate
;; inheriting `VAELII_RETE=1` measures a join nobody wrote it about — which is what
;; `join_lead_cost_test` did until its fixture pinned the matcher.
;;
;; So the roots are READ here, before a single switch installs itself, and handed back by
;; `with-shipped-config`.  Read rather than restated: a default written down a second time
;; is a default that drifts, and a captured one cannot.

(def sweeps
  "The seven configurations `scripts/test-sweeps.sh` runs, as data: the environment
  variable that selects each, and the vars whose root it replaces.  `test_util_test`
  holds the spellings against `scripts/lib/suite-configs.sh`, so a sweep added to that
  table without a row here fails — and the row is where its vars are named, which is what
  puts them in `shipped-defaults` for a counted gate to pin back.

  `VAELII_TEST_TMS` names none, and that is not an omission: the TMS is a KB **option**,
  chosen per `open-kb` rather than installed over a var, so a gate pins it by naming it in
  its space (`assert_cost_test`'s `cost-space`) and no binding could.
  `VAELII_ASSERTIVE_ARG_TYPES` names none either: `vaelii.impl.checks` reads it into its
  own root before this namespace loads, so `shipped-defaults` would capture the sweep's
  value.  `with-entailing` is its pin."

  A `:type` temp keeps the **base's own spelling**: a base already carrying an
  underscore (`physical_object`) becomes snake_case, a bare lowercase word (`dog`)
  becomes another bare lowercase word.  That distinction is required.  A
  snake_case functor names a type and is therefore legal only as a *unary* predicate
  (`vaelii.impl.naming/problems`), so spelling every type temp with underscores would
  commit it to arity 1 — a commitment a test writing `dog` or `likes` never made,
  since a bare lowercase word satisfies the predicate *and* the type convention and is
  disambiguated by arity rather than by the symbol.  Left bare, the temp is usable
  either way; writing the base with an underscore is how a test says \"a type, and
  only a type\".

  A `:predicate` temp is **bare lowercase** for the same reason read the other way.
  The naming rule is a biconditional now — snake_case is arity 1 and camelCase is arity
  2 and above — so a camelCase temp would commit to being a relation exactly as an
  underscored one commits to being a kind, and a test that wrote `wabPremise` as a base
  made neither commitment.  The base's own capitals are folded out (`wabPremise` ⇒
  `tmpwabpremise17`), which is the one spelling both conventions admit; a test that
  wants the commitment writes the base with an underscore and takes a `:type` temp."
