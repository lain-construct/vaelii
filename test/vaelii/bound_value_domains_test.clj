  "Every bound refuses a value outside its domain, by name, at every entry point that
  takes one.

  The key rosters were already held everywhere (`opts/check!`): an option nothing reads is
  `:unknown-option`.  The **value** domains are the other half — a key that *is* read
  holding a value it cannot mean.  Unchecked, the value reaches arithmetic or a call and
  throws a bare `ClassCastException`, which the daemon answers `:internal-error` (500)
  where every sibling refusal is a typed 400.  `opts/bound-domains` is the one table these
  entry points share, and `opts/check-values!` reads it; this holds each entry point to it.

  A bound of **0** is not a bad value — no time at all, no rule expansion, realize nothing
  and hand back a resumable continuation, report at every opportunity — so it is admitted
  where the entry point's own contract admits it, and only a value that is not a number of
  the right kind at all is refused."
