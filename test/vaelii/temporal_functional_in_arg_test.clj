  "A **computed** `genlCx` edge widens which merges a context can see exactly as much as a
  stated one does — vaelii#56, reported by Lain against the calendar dimension.

  `context-nat` materializes `(genlCx <january> <year>)` off a `contextArgSubrelation`
  declaration with nobody asserting it (docs/context-nat.md).  Until this closed, that
  edge reached the taxonomy and the exception re-checks and stopped there: the three
  equality reconcilers a `genlCx` edge owes were written out by hand in the assert path
  and in the rule-conclusion path, and the producer — the third entry point — called none of
  them.  So two fillers of one functional slot, made jointly visible for the first time
  by a computed month→year edge, stayed unmerged, uncontradicted and unreported, while
  the same two facts under a *stated* edge merged.  Whether they merged came down to
  whether the year's fact was written before January existed.

  The reconcilers are one call now (`special/reconcile-context-edge`), and all three
  entry points make it.  What the tests here pin is the *equivalence*: a computed edge and a
  stated one reach the same beliefs, in every order the ingredients can arrive in.

  The mark is stated **in the year context** throughout rather than in CxUniverse.  A
  reified `cx/` context is not wired under CxUniverse by anything — its ancestor set is what the
  declarations compute — so a mark left in CxUniverse is invisible from the calendar and
  the scenario would be testing the wrong absence."
