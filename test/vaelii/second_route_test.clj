  "A reader that still reaches over a second route holds a forward firing, whatever took
  the route the firing named, and in every arrival order.

  A firing names one path per reachability it rests on — the `genl` path a subsumed match
  climbed, the `genlCx` path its placement is seen over, the path a `transitiveInArg` claim
  moved along — and a second route is paid for with a re-derivation when the named one
  goes from the network, and read at the reader when a defeat or an `except` hides it
  there (docs/nmtms.md, \"Where the layer stops\").  Each case below builds two routes
  between the same ends, knocks out an edge of the named one, and compares every reader's
  answer with a KB that never held that edge.

  Five lattices — a subsumed match, a claim preserved along `genl` and along a fact
  relation, the `genlCx` path a placement is seen over (with the fact at the knocked
  edge's lower end, and in another ancestor of the reader), and two routes that tie on
  generality — and four ways to knock an edge out:

    retract    the record goes; the sweep's re-join brings the firing back
    network    a monotonic negation in the edge's own context places a defeat of it
               there; the network keeps the edge IN, and a reader that reaches the path's
               ends over edges it does not hide reads the firing (`exc/rerouted`)
    scoped     a monotonic negation in a context below the edge places the defeat at that
               vantage, read the same way below it
    except     an `(except (sentexHandle H))` hides the edge from its context and below,
               read the same way

  A network knock is compared with a KB that never held the edge at every reader; a scoped
  or excepting one only at the readers at and below its context, and with the whole KB
  above it.

  The orders are every permutation of the named route, the other route, the knock and the
  claim or fact the rule fires on, after the contexts, declarations and rule; a knock that
  names the edge's handle follows the edge.  The whole roster is `^:slow`; four of its
  orders — the knock first and last, each with either route first — run at `:default`."
