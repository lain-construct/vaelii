  "The change feed: an application told that belief moved, instead of asking again.

  Every claim here is about the *extension point*, not about inference — the engine already
  computes what a listener receives and used to discard it, so what these tests hold are
  the four things a feed can get wrong.

  * **Altitude.**  A listener hears about *belief*, not storage.  So a defeat and a
    revival both arrive, a re-asserted sentex is not news, and a `preview` — which
    stores, reads and takes it all back — is silent.
  * **Granularity.**  One settle is one event, and an operation that settles twice (a
    teardown that re-derives what it swept) is still one: a datum that went OUT and came
    back moved no net belief, and reporting both halves of that flicker is the failure
    mode.  The batch a feed reports is the batch `edit-with-consequences` reports.
  * **Reentrancy.**  Listeners run after the settle, never inside it, so one that writes
    starts a fresh settle and gets its own event — and one that throws loses its own
    event and nothing else, since the settle it is hearing about is already committed.
  * **Honesty about what it cannot answer.**  A goal whose truth is a function of
    something outside the moved region is refused rather than watched for nothing.

  House rules as everywhere: gensym'd temporaries through `tu/with-terms`, engine
  vocabulary (`genl`, `genlCx`, `set/defaultRule`, `exceptWhen`) literal, and the
  neutral fixture asserts the KB is restored."
