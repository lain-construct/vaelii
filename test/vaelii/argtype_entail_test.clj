  "Assertive argument types: `(arg parentOf 1 animal)` read as an entailment about
  the argument, not only as a constraint on it.

  The check's open-world floor is what this fills — an argument with no visible place
  in the genl hierarchy cannot violate anything, so it passes and the KB learns
  nothing, however many times it has been told that the slot holds an animal.  The
  entailment is drawn exactly there and nowhere else, and it is drawn as a **derived,
  justified** sentex: retract the fact or the declaration and the type goes with it.

  On by default (`checks/*assertive-arg-types?*`), and every test here binds it anyway, so
  a run under `VAELII_ASSERTIVE_ARG_TYPES=0` still measures the entailment."
