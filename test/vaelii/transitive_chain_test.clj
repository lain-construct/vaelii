  "Forward chaining across a transitive predicate's closure.

  A rule antecedent on a `(transitive P)` predicate matches stored edges, and a pair two
  hops apart is stored nowhere — so on its own the rule fires across one hop and a
  narrative has to write down the pairs it wants read.  The join reads the closure
  instead, and `TransitivePredicateProver` reports the edges each answer crossed, so the
  firing rests on that chain and the ordinary relabel takes the conclusion away when any
  hop of it goes.

  Three things, then, and none of them is really about deriving: that the conclusion
  arrives across two hops, that `why` names the edges behind it, and that the answer does
  not depend on which hop arrived last."
