  "A reader thread beside the writer, one level up from the network.

  `vaelii.jtms-concurrency-test` holds the same guarantee for the truth-maintenance
  structures themselves.  This is the guarantee **through the API**: the reads an
  application actually makes — `sentexes-matching`, the `genl` closure, and belief off a
  handle — while a writer asserts and retracts in bursts.  Those reads cross more state
  than the TMS: the index postings, the record store behind them, the taxonomy closure
  caches, and the literal-match cache, each of which the writer is moving.

  Four things must hold, and they are what the checks below count:

  - **No reader ever throws.**  An index posting is written before the record it points
    at is, and swept after — a read that caught either gap on an unsynchronized
    structure would fault or hand back nothing.
  - **Nothing is invented.**  Every sentence a read returns is one the writer wrote.  A
    torn posting is not a wrong answer that looks plausible; it is content from another
    handle, which is what makes this the check worth having.
  - **A read is internally consistent.**  A sentex a match returns carries its own
    sentence and handle — the posting resolved to a record inside the one read, rather
    than to a hole the sweep had already made.
  - **Locality holds under load.**  The writer churns one region; a monotonic fact and a
    taxonomy edge *outside* it are believed and true at every sample, never briefly
    false while a relabel or a closure recompute passes over something else.

  **A settle is published once.**  A settle lifts every standing defeat before it
  re-decides any, so the tests at the foot of this file seed a standing contradiction and
  read its loser beside a settle: the reader reads the belief the settle began from, and
  the writer decides on its own network and on no cache entry the reader filled.

  Both representations run, in one test, with the same assertions either way — the
  reference (persistent maps, consistent by construction) is the control, and the dense
  network (bitmaps mutated in place under a `StampedLock`) is the claim the default
  rests on.  Which one the suite's own KBs use (`VAELII_TEST_TMS`) changes nothing
  here: each arm names its representation."
