  "`vaelii.impl.asp.edge`: the encoding over hand-built `Program`s (minimal defeat, caller
  priority, content-keyed ties), the readers' handling of a result that is not an answer,
  and, on a live KB, that installing `edge-solver` leaves a represented dilemma undecided
  under every arrival order.  Each test runs only with an ASP backend reachable, since
  without one `edge-solver` is `local-solver`.

  No `:each` fixture: the permutation test rebuilds a KB per ordering on the isolated
  space, so the KB tests take `tu/with-neutral-kb` inline."
