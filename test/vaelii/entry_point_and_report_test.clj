  "One fact, one wording: a definitional check's **entry point** and its **retroactive reader**
  describe the same KB the same way.

  Several checks exist twice — once at the entry point as content arrives, once reading
  back over content admitted before the check could convict it — and the pair answers one question
  about one KB.  Neither half is wrong on its own, which is what makes the class expensive
  to debug: both messages are true statements about the same knowledge, so a reader who
  meets one and greps for the other finds nothing, and a reader who meets both concludes
  there are two problems.  The measured case is `arity`, where an inherited length reads as
  `fatherOf takes 2 arguments through parentOf` and the entry point that credited `fatherOf` with
  a declaration of its own sent an author looking for a sentence nobody wrote.

  So this is a **roster** rather than one assertion each, on `vector-spelling-test`'s
  model: the defect is never in one half, it is in two halves disagreeing, and a roster is
  what fails when the next pair is added on one side only.  The rows are
  [docs/taxonomy.md](../../docs/taxonomy.md)'s \"What each constraint does in each arrival
  order\" table, **including the cells that read \"nothing\"** — a check documented as
  having no retroactive half is a fact about the KB, and a sweep that quietly acquires one
  turns an open-world check into a closed-world one.

  What the two halves must agree on is the vocabulary a reader carries from one to the
  other: the **predicate or term blamed**, whether the constraint was **inherited** or
  declared outright, and **which stored sentex convicted**.  What they may differ on is
  said row by row, because the difference is real rather than sloppy: an entry point refuses one
  arriving sentence and names one reason, where a reader swept an extent and names a
  count.  A clash that names its members is stored at the entry point, so both halves of
  its row are the same nogood, a pair in which neither side is the newcomer."
