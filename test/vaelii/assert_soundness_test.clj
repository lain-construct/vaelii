  "Probes for the gaps where `assert`'s checks and `assert`'s *storage* can
  disagree.

  Every definitional check — naming, well-formedness, arg, disjointness,
  functionality — runs on the sentence the caller handed in.  What gets stored is
  the sentence the `sentex` constructor canonicalizes out of it.  Wherever those two
  forms differ, there is a gap, and a check that runs on one side while the other
  is stored is a check that can be walked around.

  The gaps tested here: a virtual wrapper peeled by the constructor, a conjunctive
  consequent split into several rules, and the derivation path, which stores without
  going through `assert` at all."

;; ---- gap 1: a virtual wrapper around a non-rule ------------------------
;;
;; `set/defaultRule` / `exceptWhen` / `set/forwardRule` are wrappers the sentex
;; constructor peels into record fields.  Wrapped around an *implication* that is
;; their whole purpose.  Wrapped around a plain fact they are meaningless — but the
;; constructor peels them just the same, so `(set/defaultRule (dog Felix))` stores
;; the bare fact `(dog Felix)`.
;;
;; The danger is that `assert-one` routes on `rules/rule-sentence?` of the *inner*
;; form.  A wrapped fact is not a rule, so it falls to the fact branch — where the
;; naming, well-formedness and constraint checks all run against the **wrapper**,
;; whose functor is `set/defaultRule` and whose single argument is a list.  Those
;; checks are about `(dog Felix)`; if they inspect `(set/defaultRule (dog Felix))`
;; instead, they inspect the wrong sentence and pass vacuously, and the fact is
;; stored unchecked.
