  "Forking a second JVM, for the tests that cannot be written without one.

  Not a test namespace — support, the way `vaelii.world` and `vaelii.test-util` are, so
  `lein test` never selects it.  What it is scaffolding *for* is `vaelii.multi-jvm-test`
  and the `^:multi-jvm` mark it carries (CONTRIBUTING.md §5).

  **A child is `java -cp` on this JVM's own classpath**, never `lein`.  Leiningen resolves
  the classpath once, into `java.class.path` — `src`, `test`, the resource directories and
  every jar — so a child inherits it for the cost of reading a system property.  Shelling
  out to `lein classpath` per child would charge each one a dependency resolution, and
  spawning `lein` itself would charge twenty seconds of boot for three seconds of work.

  **The handshake is a marker line, never a sleep.**  A child prints `##vaelii## <word>`
  when it reaches a state the parent is waiting for, and the parent blocks on that line
  with a deadline.  The prefix is there because a child's own logging shares the stream:
  a bare `HELD` would match a trove line quoting the word.  Nothing here polls, and
  nothing waits a fixed interval and hopes.

  Every child's stderr is folded into its stdout and kept, so a failure reports the
  child's transcript — a stack trace in a process the test framework cannot see is
  otherwise a timeout with no cause attached."
