  ;; The prover refines a `:refinable` member with the backend's `classify-program`, so on
  ;; dilemmas whose members derive from none of the others the two must classify each member
  ;; the same way.  `classify-program` classifies the members a `Program` holds; the
  ;; comparison covers every one of those that `classify-local` also classifies.
  ;;
  ;; The fixtures are dilemmas whose members derive from none of the other members.
  ;; `dilemma-program` encodes each member as an independent choice with no derivation
  ;; between members, so on `three-way-rebuttal` the backend counts defeating `b` and the
  ;; `¬a`/`¬c` it derives as three defeats and reports all six members `:supportable`, while
  ;; `classify-local` reads the cascade and resolves the cluster by defeating `b` alone.
