  "The four relation properties added in #14, enforced rather than declared:

  * **`irreflexive`** — a self tuple `(P a a)` is a one-member nogood each reader
    decides: a `:default` one is OUT where the mark is read, a `:monotonic` one is a
    hard clash in `conflicts`.
  * **`anti_symmetric`** — a believed converse `(P b a)` of two symbols merges the two
    arguments, deriving `(equals a b)`; a converse of two arguments no merge reconciles
    is a two-member nogood each reader decides.
  * **`anti_transitive`** — the two-step chain and the direct step are convicted
    **together**, as the one nogood whose members are three rather than two
    (docs/nmtms.md).  Its classification and `(disjoint transitive anti_transitive)` are
    enforced beside that.
  * **`equivalence_relation`** — no engine code: three CxCore forward rules derive
    `symmetric`, `transitive` and `reflexive`, each enforced in turn.

  A CxCore-loaded KB on the collapsed single-predicate model (an algebraic property is one
  predicate, not a mark and a twin): each new property is one predicate with `(genl X
  binary_predicate)`, and the lattice sits on the bare marks — so the SHIPPED declarations
  are what is tested, not a hand-built fixture that could drift from the file."
