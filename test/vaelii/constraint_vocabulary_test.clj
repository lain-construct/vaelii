  "Declared vocabulary that convicts something, and vocabulary that convicts nothing and
  says so.

  Two findings, one theme — a KB author gets identical silence from a constraint that is
  enforced and one that was never implemented, and each of these closes one way that
  happened:

  * **`arity` reaches back.**  A tuple of a length its predicate's binding breaks is a
    one-member nogood each reader decides, whichever of the two arrived first.  The
    binding is on the forced-monotonic roster, so the nogood never takes it OUT.

  * **`interArg` exists.**  It was a plausible-looking declaration that stored fine and
    did nothing.  The conditional argument constraint reads open-world *twice, in opposite
    directions*, which is what these tests are mostly about: silence about the trigger
    argument's type leaves it dormant, silence about the target's is what convicts.

  The third finding of the same shape — that the grammar itself is now audited, so a new
  declaration nobody classified fails a test rather than landing in silence — needs a
  CxCore baseline where these need a cleared one, and lives in
  `vocabulary-audit-test`."
