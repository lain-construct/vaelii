  "The exception re-check of a settle that queued many `{::preserving s}` markers: what
  each marker's `inherit/moved-goal-test` reads, and that reading it cheaply answers as
  reading it whole did.

  A `genl` edge into a type moves the goals of a predicate preserved along `genl` whose
  arguments the type's reach names, and with `(transitive P)` that reach is joined with
  `P`'s own facts (`inherit/reach`): every term of the type's closure, and a `P` literal
  of each.  Three things keep a batch of such edges from costing a reach each:

  * the re-check reads every marker under one question memo (`recheck/exception-candidates`);
  * the test is a membership over the reaches the memo holds, not their union copied;
  * a `P` literal's fan is cut by the slot predicate sets whatever its size
    (`res/*cut-every-fan?*`), so a term no fact of `P` names costs the slot reads.

  Each is checked here against the reading it replaced."
