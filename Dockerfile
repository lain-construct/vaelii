# the daemon itself — up on a scratch store until `/health` answers, then stopped, the
# cache written at its exit — so the cache holds what a start loads.  It is built here
# rather than in the build stage because a cache is valid only for the JVM build and the
# jar that made it, and these are the ones the container runs; the flags match the
# entry point's for the same reason.  A daemon over an empty store that reads it answers
# `/health` in 0.58 s against 1.61 s without (2026-09-28), for about 90 MB of image.

# The store.  One container per directory: the `:disk` backend takes an exclusive

# Unset, the log level installs **no backend at all** — a container that writes
# nothing is one nobody can operate, so the image names a level the operator can
# override rather than inheriting silence.
ENV VAELII_LOG_LEVEL=info

# No `-Xmx`.  A JVM in a container reads the cgroup limit, so the operator's
# `--memory` is the heap ceiling; a baked value would override it and be wrong at
# every size but the one it was written for.
#
# No collector flag either, and that is a measured answer rather than an omission.
# `lein perf` over two alternating passes at a fixed 6 GiB heap: the JDK default
# took 40.7-41.2 s at 1493-1510 MB peak RSS, generational ZGC 55.5-55.9 s at
# 6224-6258 MB — 36% slower holding 4.2x the resident set, and ZGC alone tripped
# the `:negation-arbitration` growth bound on both passes.  A concurrent collector
# earns its throughput cost on a live set of tens of gigabytes, and this engine's
# peak here is 1.5 GB — and in a container the resident set is what the memory limit
# is set against.  `lein with-profile +zgc` selects it for a JVM that has a reason.
#
# `clojure.main -m` rather than `java -jar`: `:gen-class` is on `vaelii.core`, so
# the jar's Main-Class is the API entry point and not this one.
#
# The first three flags are project.clj's top-level `:jvm-opts`, which an uberjar does
# not carry: without the two `--` ones JDK 25 warns when JNA loads a native solver and
# when nippy's LZ4 (aircompressor) calls `sun.misc.Unsafe`, and compact object headers
# hold about 8% less heap.  `-XX:AOTCache` reads the cache the training run above wrote.
