# Qualitative constraint networks — one engine, six algebras

- **Covers:** how the generic path-consistency engine turns a relation algebra
  and a network into entailment, refutation and support that every calculus reuses.
- **Not here:** the specific spatial algebras (RCC-8, direction, distance) →
  [space.md](space.md); the temporal algebras (Allen's intervals, the point algebra) →
  [time.md](time.md).
- **Assumes:** sentex, context, genlCx, belief → [glossary.md](glossary.md).

`vaelii.impl.qcn` reasons about relations that have no numbers behind them: *inside*,
*north of*, *before*. You rarely know where a region's boundary runs or what o'clock a
meeting started, but you do know how things stand relative to one another — and that is
enough to derive relations nobody stated.

The engine knows nothing about a KB, a context, or belief. Pure data in, pure data out.
A relation **algebra** is a parameter and a **network** is a value, so a new calculus is
a table and a prover rather than a second reasoner. Six ship — the three standard
qualitative-spatial questions (topology, orientation, distance) and three about time and
frame:

| Namespace | Calculus | Base relations | Doc |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----|
| `vaelii.impl.space` | RCC-8 topology — do two regions touch, overlap, nest? | 8 | [space.md](space.md) |
| `vaelii.impl.orientation` | cardinal direction — which way is one place from another? | 9 | [space.md](space.md) |
| `vaelii.impl.relative` | relative direction — left, right, in front, behind | 9 | [space.md](space.md) |
| `vaelii.impl.distance` | qualitative distance — how far apart, in classes | 7 | [space.md](space.md) |
| `vaelii.impl.interval` | Allen's interval algebra — how are two stretches of time ordered? | 13 | [time.md](time.md) |
| `vaelii.impl.point` | the point algebra — before, equal, after, over instants | 3 | [time.md](time.md) |

Three of the six composition tables are written out by hand — Allen's 13×13
(`interval/allen-composition`), RCC-8's 8×8 (`space/rcc8-composition`) and the point
algebra's 3×3 (`point/point-composition`). The other three are **computed**: the two
direction algebras from two independent axis projections, distance from the triangle
inequality over its class bounds.

The two direction algebras are computed by the same code, `vaelii.impl.projection`, from
one table each — nine relations onto the nine `[x y]` pairs of two three-valued axes.
That table has to be a **bijection** onto all nine, and the constructor refuses one that
is not (`:bad-algebra`) rather than letting composition discover it: a missing pair
composes to `nil` and gets stored as though it were a relation, and a repeated pair still
covers all nine while the inverse map silently drops one of the two relations sharing it.
So the count is checked as well as the coverage. Both shipped tables are bijections; the
refusal is for a caller building a calculus of their own.

A transcribed table can be mistyped into a wrong entailment reported with full
confidence, so two of the three are re-derived from first principles by their tests and
compared entry for entry: `interval_test` lays out three intervals every way six
endpoints admit and reads the three relations off, `point_test` does the same over three
instants. **RCC-8's table has no such test** — regions have no coordinates to enumerate,
so there is nothing to derive it from. Its 64 entries are checked only by the pairs the
suite exercises, and a mistyped cell in a corner nothing queries would survive.

Two things nearby are deliberately *not* calculi. `vaelii.impl.stp` is metric time —
numeric bounds closed by shortest paths, not a relation algebra, and forcing it through
one would be a category error ([stp.md](stp.md)). `vaelii.impl.scenario` is the search
that turns a network's per-pair *sets* into one concrete arrangement, and it is generic
over every calculus here ([scenario.md](scenario.md)).

Each gets path consistency, the inconsistency verdict, the entailment reading, the
refutation reading, support-carrying derivation and the caches unchanged. They are
mutually independent: no shared predicate, and no network ever sees another calculus's
facts.

The split is two namespaces, not one. `vaelii.impl.qcn` is the algorithm and knows
nothing about a KB. `vaelii.impl.qcn-kb` is the *other* half of the seam — reading
believed facts in, reading entailments back out — and it is the same half for every
calculus, so it is written once. A **calculus** is what actually differs:

```clojure
{:name       :rcc8                ; names the cache and the report
 :algebra    rcc8-algebra         ; the qcn relation algebra
 :denotation {'partOfRegion #{:tpp :ntpp :eq} …}}   ; predicate -> base relations
```

`qcn-kb/calculus` bundles those three; the reader, the caches, the four goal shapes and
the prover follow from them. Each algebra namespace is then its table, its vocabulary,
and a dozen lines of delegation.

## The algebra and the network

A **relation algebra** is a map:

```clojure
{:universe  #{…}          ; every base relation — the constraint on an unknown pair
 :identity  #{…}          ; the singleton constraint on the diagonal (i,i)
 :compose   (fn [s1 s2])  ; composition of two relation sets
 :converse  (fn [s])}     ; the converse of a relation set
```

The base relations must be **jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint** — exactly one
holds of any two objects — which is what makes a *set* of them a constraint saying "one
of these", and an empty set a contradiction.

A **network** is `{[i j] → #{base relations}}`, both directions stored; an unrecorded
pair is the universe. A network is a plain value, which is what lets a caller memoize an
expensive pass on its content.

`constraint` reads a pair: the identity on the diagonal, the recorded set, else the
universe. Note the order — the diagonal answers the identity *whatever* is recorded
there, because the only relation a thing can stand in to itself is the identity.

## Path consistency

`path-consistent` enforces composition closure — for every triple `(i j k)`, tighten
`R(i,k) ∩= R(i,j)∘R(j,k)`, to a fixpoint. Tightening is monotone over a finite universe,
so it terminates; both directions are written on every tightening, so `constraint` never
has to consult the converse.

`nodes` is the second argument and it is where the triples come from, so passing every
node the network mentions is the **caller's** obligation: tightening reaches only the
nodes it is given, and one left out is a path composition left unmade — a silently
weaker answer, never a wrong one. Extra nodes are always safe, which is why every
algebra passes the network's own nodes plus whatever the goal names. The result does not
depend on the *order* of `nodes`: tightening only narrows and composition is monotone in
⊆, so the loop lands on the unique greatest fixpoint below the network it was handed,
and the order decides how many revisits that takes and nothing else.

It returns the tightened network, or **`:inconsistent`** the moment a constraint
empties — an empty constraint says two nodes can stand in no relation at all, which no
model satisfies. Two shapes of contradiction are unsatisfiable *as given* and can never
be reported by tightening, so both are checked up front, over the whole network rather
than over the node list:

- A constraint that arrives **already empty**. The loop only reports a constraint it
  narrows to nothing, and an empty one cannot be narrowed further, so without the check
  the verdict on two contradictory facts about one pair would depend on whether some
  third node happened to route through it.
- A **diagonal** constraint that excludes the identity — a claim that a thing stands to
  itself in some relation it cannot. Every triple has `i ≠ k`, so no triple ever visits a
  diagonal, and `constraint` answers the identity there regardless; the claim would
  otherwise be silently dropped instead of reported. A reader produces one exactly when
  an asserted `(P a a)` survives intersection with its own converse, i.e. when P is
  symmetric: `(spatiallyDisconnected A A)` records `#{:dc}` on the diagonal and is
  unsatisfiable, where `(nonTangentialProperPart A A)` empties and is caught by the first
  check. A believed `(not (spatiallyEqual A A))` is the negative way to write one.

### Greatest, not least

The loop lands on the **greatest** fixpoint, and which end it comes from is not a detail
of the implementation — it is what the answer means.

A fixpoint is a network `X` with `tighten(X) = X`, and there is generally more than one.
Tightening is monotone over a finite lattice, so a smallest and a largest both exist, and
you reach them by iterating from the corresponding end: from the empty network upward, or
from the network as given downward. Path consistency starts at the top — every pair
unconstrained, every base relation still possible — and only ever removes. That is the
greatest fixpoint below the input, and it says **nothing is ruled out that the constraints
do not rule out**.

Which end the loop starts from is not a free choice: the least fixpoint of the same
operator is a different, degenerate answer — every constraint set to `#{}`, stable but
claiming that every KB's theory is contradictory. [why greatest, not
least](defenses.md#path-consistency-computes-the-greatest-fixpoint-not-the-least)

Both are unique, which is what makes both order-independent. That is the property the
engine actually needs, and it is available at either end — but only at an end.

**Why this makes the calculus awkward to express elsewhere.** Datalog and ASP compute
least fixpoints; that *is* their semantics, and it is why "not derivable" is well defined
in them. A removing fixpoint has to be simulated, and the complement does not help: saying
a relation survives means "**for every** intermediate node, some composition supports it",
and a universal is a negated existential, so the recursion runs through negation either
way. The practical encoding is a bounded round iteration with each round in its own
relation — because stratification in those engines is per *relation*, not per ground atom,
one relation carrying the round as an argument is a cycle through negation. Soufflé
rejects such a program outright; gringo accepts it, fails to evaluate it while grounding,
and ships the whole cubic rule to the solver. Measured on 64 regions, that is 15.9 GB
against 755 MB for the unrolled form computing the identical answer.

### The arc queue

That order-independence is what lets the loop be **PC-2** rather than a re-sweep. A triple
needs visiting only if one of the two constraints it *reads* has narrowed since it was
last looked at. Each narrowed pair goes on a queue in both directions (both are written on
every tightening, and either can be an input); draining it visits, for a pair `[a b]`, the
triples `(a b m)` and `(m a b)` — every triple with that pair as an input, and nothing
else. Draining can enqueue more, and it terminates because every entry costs a strict
narrowing over a finite universe.

At the fixpoint every triple has been examined since its inputs last changed, which is
the same closure the repeated sweep reaches: a pair *being* narrowed never invalidates a
triple that reads it, since a subset of a set that was already contained is still
contained.

Revisiting is done by **whichever is cheaper**, and the two costs are directly
comparable: draining is `2 × changed × (n-2)` triple visits, another sweep is
`n(n-1) × (n-2)`. A sparse network moves a handful of pairs and drains for a rounding
error; a network that pins nearly *every* pair would cost about two sweeps to drain, and
sweeping again is less work. That is not a heuristic with a threshold in it — it is the
two counts, compared. Either route runs the same step to the same fixpoint, so the choice
is cost and nothing else.

**The first look need not be a sweep either.** A network read out of a KB records a
constraint at a handful of pairs and leaves the rest unknown, and a triple reading two
unknowns narrows nothing where the algebra composes the universe to itself — so on a first
pass the recorded pairs are the only ones a triple can learn from. There are `m` of those
against the `n(n-1)` a sweep visits, and where `m` is small, seeding the queue with them is
the same saving the queue makes *after* a sweep, made before one.

What the estimate cannot see is how much the network will turn out to narrow: a sparse
input can still close to a dense output, and then draining costs more than sweeping. So the
first drain is **budgeted** at one sweep's worth of pops and gives up rather than run away.
Giving up costs nothing that was earned — the array only ever narrows, and the fixpoint
below the network it started from is unique — so the sweep route simply finishes from
there. The two outcomes are exactly the two shapes: the containment tree closes with **no
sweep at all**, the total order bails and sweeps, and `qcn_queue_test` pins both by
counting sweeps and checking each answer against the re-sweeping reference.

`path-consistent-naive` is the re-sweeping reference, kept and public. `qcn_queue_test`
runs both over randomized networks across four algebras (3, 8, 9 and 13 base relations)
and several node counts, seeded so a failure reproduces, and asserts they agree network
for network and verdict for verdict. Two implementations that share their tightening step
and differ only in which triples they revisit can agree only by both being right.

One shortcut sits inside the step, and it is decided once per run rather than per triple:
a triple both of whose inputs are *unknown* can narrow nothing when the algebra composes
the universe to itself, which every jointly-exhaustive algebra does. Where the runtime
check says otherwise, nothing is skipped. In a sparse network that is most of the triples.

### Warm-starting: semi-naive over the network

A KB being loaded asks for the pass again after every arriving fact, and all but a handful
of the pairs are exactly where the last run left them. Closing the whole network again is
the cubic loop redoing work it has already done.

So a run that can be told what moved starts from the previous answer:
`qcn/path-consistent-from` takes a network and an earlier *result* for a network the new
one **narrows**, and revisits only the triples reading a pair that moved. The seeds go
straight onto the arc queue — there is no first sweep to make, since the previous run
already made it — and the same cost comparison decides between draining and sweeping, for
the same reason.

The identity that licenses it falls out of ["greatest, not least"](#greatest-not-least).
Path consistency computes the greatest fixpoint below the network it is handed, so for any
narrowing `c`:

    PC(N ∩ c) = PC(PC(N) ∩ c)

Both sides sit below `N ∩ c`. The left is a fixpoint below `PC(N)` (monotonicity), so it
is below the right; the right is a fixpoint below `N ∩ c`, so it is below the left. Hence
equal — warm-starting is not an approximation, it is the same answer reached without
re-deriving what did not move.

**It applies to narrowing only.** A retraction or a withdrawn belief *widens*, and there
is no such identity: a fixpoint cannot be run backwards, because its result does not
record which of its narrowings the departing constraint was behind. `qcn/narrowing-of?` is
the precondition, checked by the caller against the network the previous answer was
computed from, and a widening pays the whole pass. That is the honest trade rather than a
gap — and retraction is rare where loading is not.

Two things are deliberately outside it. The **support-carrying** pass is never warm-started:
a warm start keeps the supports the previous run accumulated, so which handles an
entailment names would become a function of the order the facts arrived in — and those
handles become a firing's antecedents. The closed network is a unique greatest fixpoint
and so is order-independent whichever way it is reached; the support is one witness among
several, and only a run from nothing picks the same witness every time. And **nodes are
read off the merged network** rather than taken from the caller: a warm start is taken
exactly when facts have arrived, and an arriving fact routinely names a node the previous
network never held. A node left out is a node no triple visits, so its every composition
goes unmade — and the answer comes back looking merely uninformative rather than wrong,
which is the failure mode a test has to be built to see.

`qcn_queue_test` walks a randomized *narrowing sequence* over each algebra — one arriving
constraint at a time, nodes appearing as it goes — warm-starting each step off the last
answer and checking it against a run of the re-sweeping reference from nothing. Passing
the warm call no node set at all is part of that test rather than an oversight.

### Cost

Measured by `lein bench-qcn` on two shapes — a containment tree of regions (RCC-8, the
sparse realistic case) and a total order of intervals (Allen, the dense worst case) —
each the fastest of three runs, with `path-consistent-naive` alongside as the reference:

| nodes | triples/sweep | tree | tree, re-sweeping | order | order, re-sweeping |
|-------|---------------|------|-------------------|-------|--------------------|
| 10  | 720 | 0.08 ms | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.09 ms |
| 20  | 6,840 | 0.17 ms | 0.23 ms | 0.43 ms | 0.44 ms |
| 40  | 59,280 | 0.54 ms | 1.7 ms | 2.2 ms | 2.6 ms |
| 80  | 492,960 | 2.1 ms | 8.6 ms | 14 ms | 23 ms |
| 160 | 4,019,520 | 7.3 ms | 65 ms | 99 ms | 122 ms |

The queue's win is **8.9× on the sparse tree** at 160 nodes and grows with size (1.4× at
20, 3.2× at 40, 4.1× at 80); on the dense total order it is 1.2–1.7× and does not, because
that shape pins every pair and the driver ends up sweeping either way. Both shapes are
below the noise at ten nodes, where a whole pass is a tenth of a millisecond.

The **re-sweeping** column is the floor a sweep-based pass cannot get under: cubic in
nodes, not in facts, since it visits n(n-1)(n-2) triples however few constraints there are.
The queue is only bounded by that floor when the network actually closes dense — a sparse
one never sweeps at all and is bounded by what it narrows instead, which is why the tree
column pulls away as *n* grows and the order column does not. A couple of hundred nodes in
one context is the working range for the dense case.

Two constant factors apply whichever route a run takes. Skipping a triple whose two
inputs are both unknown is worth **2.6×** on the tree with the queue held out of it, and
the bitmask representation below is worth **31×** on it.

### Bitmasks, not sets

Relation sets are the *interface* — what a calculus writes, what a caller reads, what
every example above is stated in. They are not the arithmetic. A pass does exactly three
things to a constraint: intersect it, compose it with another, take its converse. An
algebra has a handful of base relations — eight for RCC-8, thirteen for Allen, the widest
that ships — so a constraint fits in the bits of a long, and then intersection is
`bit-and`, emptiness is `zero?`, the containment an entailment asks about is one `bit-and`
compared against its argument, and composition and converse are array reads.

So `path-consistent` encodes the network into a flat `long[n·n]` for the duration of the
run, tightens it in place, and decodes the pairs it touched back into sets on the way out.
The array is local to the run and never escapes; a caller sees the same immutable network
value it always did. Two kinds of entry cannot live in the array and are carried through
untouched: a **diagonal** pair, which no triple visits and which `constraint` answers the
identity for anyway, and one naming a node outside the `nodes` argument, which tightening
was never going to reach.

Nothing about this reaches a calculus. The compilation derives everything from the algebra
exactly as written — the base relations ordered **by name**, so the encoding is a function
of content rather than of set iteration order — and is cached on the algebra value itself.
The two tables are built by dynamic programming over the *base* relations: composition and
converse both distribute over union, R∘S being by definition the union of the pairwise
compositions, so `f(s) = f(s minus its lowest relation) | f(that relation)` and a
whole-mask table costs k² calls into the algebra plus one OR per entry rather than k·2^k
calls. Allen's thirteen relations make the widest table at 106,496 entries; an algebra too
wide for one falls back to reading the base table a pair at a time, which allocates nothing
either way. That distributivity is the one assumption in the layer, and a wrong table entry
would be a wrong *entailment* reported with full confidence rather than a crash — so
`qcn_mask_test` holds both tables against the algebra's own set-valued `:compose` and
`:converse`, exhaustively where 2^k allows and over a seeded sample where it does not,
across all six calculi and a synthetic one wide enough to take the fallback.

Measured on the same two shapes, against the same pass over relation sets. **These are
not the numbers above**: that table measures the incremental queue against a full
re-sweep with relations already held as masks, and this one measures the mask
representation against Clojure sets over the whole naive pass — so the same shape at the
same size reads differently in each, and only the ratio within a table means anything.

| nodes | tree, sets | tree, masks | order, sets | order, masks |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 20  | 3.4 ms | 0.25 ms | 7.4 ms | 0.44 ms |
| 40  | 22 ms | 0.99 ms | 63 ms | 2.6 ms |
| 80  | 154 ms | 5.6 ms | 0.53 s | 17 ms |
| 160 | 1.15 s | 37 ms | 5.0 s | 121 ms |

**31× on the tree and 41× on the total order**, at 160 nodes, and the gap widens with size
because what it removes is allocation. Every `pinned` count is identical, which is the
check that matters: the representation changed, the answers did not.

Two things the measurements settled rather than assumed. Composition and converse are a
**primitive interface** (`IRelationOps`) rather than a pair of closures, because a Clojure
function taking and returning a long boxes both ways through `IFn.invoke` — worth 1.42× on
the dense shape, where constraint sets are large and nearly every triple composes. And the
triple *walk* was tried the same way and **left as an ordinary closure**: boxing three loop
indices per visit measured as nothing at all, the JIT having already dealt with it, so the
interface would have been machinery bought for no return.

**Soundness.** Path consistency is sound, and decides each of these algebras over its
maximal tractable subclass. On the full language it can leave a network path-consistent
yet globally unsatisfiable, so an entailment reported here is real but a *non*-entailment
means **"not provable", never "provably false"** — the same open-world reading `arg`
and `exceptWhen` take.

## What every algebra does with it

The six provers are line-for-line the same shape, so the pattern is worth stating once.

**Reading in.** One `res/matches-visible` per predicate of the calculus — belief- and
context-filtered, so a defeated or invisible fact never reaches the network. Each
asserted `(P a b)` intersects the `(a b)` constraint with P's denotation and the `(b a)`
constraint with its converse, so two facts about one pair narrow it together.
Intersection is commutative and associative, so the network is a function of the believed
facts alone, never of the order they were asserted or read in. Believed **negative**
facts narrow it too — see [Negation](#negation-refutation-and-negative-facts-as-constraints).

**Reading out.** A goal `(P a b)` is answered by **entailment**: it holds iff every
relation still possible between a and b satisfies P —

```
possible(a, b) ⊆ denotation(P)
```

Base predicates denote singletons; **derived** predicates denote disjunctions, and so are
entailed by more networks than any base one. An emptied constraint anywhere means the
asserted network is unsatisfiable, and then *no* goal of that calculus is answered: an
inconsistent theory should not be mined for conclusions.

Four goal shapes, on which arguments are bound:

- **ground / ground** — a check: `[{}]` when entailed, nothing otherwise.
- **ground / variable** (either side) — enumerate the nodes, binding the variable to each
  entailed one.
- **two distinct variables** — enumerate the entailed pairs, off the diagonal, which a
  reflexive denotation would otherwise report for every node on its own.
- **one variable twice** (`(P ?x ?x)`) — the diagonal itself, so a denotation containing
  the identity answers every node and an irreflexive one answers none.

## Negation: refutation, and negative facts as constraints

The base relations are jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint, so **exactly one** holds
of any pair. That is what makes a negation informative here where the engine's
open-world default rightly refuses it elsewhere: "not P" is not an absence of knowledge,
it is the constraint "one of the relations P does not denote". Both directions of that
are wired.

**A negative goal is answered by refutation.** `(not (P a b))` holds iff *no* relation
still possible between a and b satisfies P —

```
possible(a, b) ∩ denotation(P) = ∅
```

Note the asymmetry with the positive reading, which needs containment where this needs
disjointness. A pair the network leaves genuinely open satisfies neither, and answers
nothing either way. So a chain of NTPPs answers `(not (spatiallyDisconnected A D))` as
readily as it answers `(partOfRegion A D)` — the composition pinned the pair, and DC is
not in what is left. The soundness runs one way only: **a refutation is real, and a
failure to refute is still "not provable", never "provably true".** All four goal shapes
behave identically under either polarity.

A negative goal reaches the prover in the shape the caller wrote it, `(not (P a b))` —
the same surface convention `FactProver` hands to `matches-visible`, which reads the `not`
frame as the pattern's polarity.

**A negative fact is a constraint.** A believed `(not (P a b))` intersects the `(a b)`
constraint with the **complement** of P's denotation, and `(b a)` with the complement of
the converse — which is the same thing, since converse is a bijection on the base
relations and so commutes with complement. So `(not (regionConnectedTo A B))` rules out
all seven relations C denotes and leaves `#{:dc}`, and a *negative* fact has entailed a
*positive* goal nobody stated. Order-independence survives unchanged: intersection is
still commutative and associative, and a complement is a fixed function of a denotation.

A negative fact that empties a constraint — `(nonTangentialProperPart A B)` alongside
`(not (partOfRegion A B))` — is an inconsistency, and it reaches the violations ledger
through the existing `unsatisfiable-as-given?` path with no special case. Nothing outside
the calculus sees that clash: the two are different predicates, so there is no nogood, no
defeat, and both stay believed. Only the network knows they cannot both hold.

**So a negative fact owes every trigger a positive one owes**, and the one thing standing
in the way is its own functor. A calculus is claimed by a *predicate*, and `(not (ntpp A
B))`'s outermost functor is `not`, which claims nothing — so both places that ask "did a
fact of some calculus just arrive?" read the sentence's **underlying body**
(`sentex/underlying-body`, the same peel the predicate-keyed re-check trigger takes).
Those two are the whole of it: `chain`'s re-join, which is what finds the relation a
negative fact has newly entailed, and `special/recheck-on-qualitative`, which is what puts
a firing in front of `entailment-withdrawn?` when a negative fact is what made the theory
impossible. Miss them and the arrival order of a rule and a negative fact decides what the
KB believes — a network that answers `(not (regionConnectedTo A D))`'s entailment to `ask`
while no forward rule ever fires on it, and an unsatisfiable network still licensing the
conclusion it drew before.

The negative half of the read is fetched differently from the positive half, for an index
reason worth stating. A negative fact's trie key carries its whole body as a single token
(`[:false (P a b) ctx]`), so the trie answers a *ground* negative lookup and nothing else
— an open `(not (P ?a ?b))` compares the token `(P ?0 ?1)` against `(P A B)` and matches
nothing. The **functor root** indexes either polarity under the positive body's functor,
so that is what enumerates them, with belief, context visibility and `except` removal
applied exactly as `matches-visible` applies them to the positive read. It is the
predicate's own extent, with no fan over the genl spec closure — under negation
subsumption runs the other way (a negated *super*-predicate entails the negated sub, never
the reverse), so the positive read's spec fan would be unsound, and nothing is lost
because a wider predicate contributes its own larger complement when it is read in turn.

## Support: what an entailed relation rests on

`path-consistent-with-support` carries `{[i j] → #{handle}}` alongside the constraints. An
**asserted** constraint's support is the handles of the sentexes the reader intersected
into it; a **tightened** one's is the union of the supports of the two constraints that
composed to narrow it, plus its own prior support. `qcn-kb/support` asks it of the KB —
"which stored sentexes support this entailed relation?" — and `qcn-kb/inconsistency-culprits`
asks the same of the pair that emptied in an impossible network.

```clojure
(qkb/support space/rcc8 kb 'CxUniverse 'A 'D)   ; => #{h1 h2}, the chain behind A ⊏ D
```

Two things it is **not**, and both matter.

It is not **minimal**. Support accumulates on every narrowing, so a pair narrowed twice
keeps the first narrowing's support even where the second subsumed it.

It is not **every** derivation. Support propagates only where a constraint *moves*, so a
second route that re-derives a value a first route already reached contributes nothing:
what comes back is *a* witness, not the set of all of them. That is deliberate, and it is
exactly what a justification is — one support list, with a second derivation earning a
second justification rather than a longer one. Unioning across re-derivations would mean
iterating the support system to its own fixpoint over every triple whether or not anybody
asked. So retracting the reported set destroys *that* derivation; where the network has an
independent second route the relation survives, and asking again names the survivor.

And it is the witness **the route the fixpoint took** accumulated, so which triples the
pass visits in which order decides which handles come back. The tightened network cannot
move — it is the unique greatest fixpoint — but the support can, and a change to the
driver's cost decisions moves it. It stays a deterministic function of `[network,
asserted support]`, which is what order-independence needs: the same believed facts name
the same handles however they were asserted. It is not additionally stable across engine
versions, and nothing should be built on a particular witness.

What is guaranteed is the direction a caller needs: every handle named is a sentex really
read into this network, and the reported set is enough to have produced the relation on
its own.

The pass is memoized in the calculus's own `:support-cache`, keyed on the network **and
its asserted support** — where `tighten`'s key is the network alone. That difference is
load-bearing: retracting a fact and re-asserting the same sentence yields the identical
network at a different handle, so the network alone does not determine the support.

Which pair is blamed for an inconsistency only *composition* finds depends on which one
the fixpoint empties first, so the culprits are a diagnosis rather than a canonical
explanation — the verdict does not depend on that, only the blame does. That is why the
violations ledger records `unsatisfiable-pairs`, a function of the network alone, and
leaves the culprit set to a caller who asks for it.

**Reporting an impossible network.** When the pass returns `:inconsistent`, the calculus
appends a `:qualitative-inconsistency` entry to the KB's violations ledger — the
`(violations kb)` a caller already reads — naming the calculus, the context, the nodes,
and the pairs that are unsatisfiable *as written* (absent when only composition found it).
Otherwise an impossible KB answers nothing and says nothing about why.

It is deliberately **not** a `wff` check. [why not a wff
check](defenses.md#an-impossible-network-is-reported-off-the-pass-not-thrown-as-a-wff-check)

The entry is filed once per network **per KB and context**, which is not the same thing as
once per pass. The pass is memoized on the network *value* and so is shared — two contexts
seeing the same constraints, or two KBs holding them, run it once between them — and a
report riding on it would fire for whichever asked first and leave the rest answering
nothing with an empty ledger to explain it. So it hangs off `observe/newly-seen?`, which
asks whether *this* KB has said *this* about *this* context yet. A query loop still reports
once, and a change of belief yields a different network and reports again.

**Cost, completeness, registration.** `cost` is **`:compute`** — a fixpoint over the
stored facts before the first answer, a closure rather than a search. `completeness` is
**100**: nothing else reasons about these predicates, and the answer is a property of the
*whole* network rather than of any one stored fact, so the dispatcher runs the prover
alone and a raw fact match would add nothing it does not already entail. `est-bindings`
is bounded by the node count, itself bounded by the number of stored facts on that
prover's own predicates — a sum of O(1) functor-root reads, because an estimate must not
cost what it estimates.

Three caches, answering different questions:

* the **pass** is memoized on the network **value**, in an atom the calculus owns. Sound
  because the network is derived from the believed facts: any change to them yields a
  different map and so a different key. The key is the network alone, not the node set —
  a node the goal names but no fact mentions is isolated, every constraint it takes part
  in is the universe, and the universe composes to itself, so it can tighten nothing.
* the **network read is resident**, on the KB's own `:qcn` atom, keyed `[calculus context]`
  and stamped with `observe/change-clock` — the KB is read once and the network reused
  until the engine mutates something. See the next section.
* the **support-carrying pass** has its own atom, so an ordinary query never pays to
  propagate support nobody asked for. Its key is the network *and* the asserted support,
  for the reason given above.

Both passes are held **resident in front of** their content key as well, and that is a
cost fix rather than a second cache: a network is a map with an entry per node pair, so
looking one up *as a key* costs a full map comparison at every hit — at a hundred nodes,
more work than the read it was saving. A resident network is the same object read after
read, so `identical?` settles it in a reference compare. It stays a fast path and never an
authority: a caller passing some other network falls straight through to the content key
and is answered about the network it actually asked about.

## The network is resident, and the clock is what makes that sound

A network is read out of the KB once and then lives on the KB until the engine mutates
something. What decides "until" is `observe/change-clock`, a single global counter bumped
at three kinds of place:

* a sentex is **stored** (`kb/create-sentex`) or **leaves** (`integrate/sentex-removed!`);
* any mutating **`jtms`** entry point runs — every one of them, bumped on the wrappers
  rather than inside the two representations, so one bump apiece is exhaustive by
  construction and neither representation can forget one;
* the **taxonomy** is written, by a watch on its atom rather than a bump per mutator —
  there are two dozen of those, and the point of a clock is that no write can forget it.

Two bulk operations bump it by hand, because they move a whole store without passing
either choke point: `core/clear!` and `reindex/reindex`.

Between them those cover what a network is a function of: which sentexes exist, which of
them are believed, and the `genlCx` cone and `genl` spec fan the read looks through.
So an unmoved clock says rebuilding would produce the identical map.

The clock is deliberately **coarse** — it says only that something moved, never what, and
not even in which KB. A network is therefore re-derived more often than it strictly must
and never less, which is the direction a correctness argument wants: residency is reused
only across a stretch in which the engine performed no mutation at all, and that is
exactly the stretch a settle pass, a query, or a prover loop spends reading. Making it
finer would mean deciding, at each choke point, which caches a change is relevant to —
the judgement that gets a cache wrong.

Nothing here is content-keyed and it does not need to be. The expensive *derivations* over
a resident value stay keyed on that value, so two KBs that reach the same network still
share one pass; this layer is about not reading the KB again, and reading the KB again is
a per-KB question.

**One thing the clock cannot supply**, and it is the reason `observe/*pin*` exists.
Forward chaining writes while it reads: a rule's join is a lazy seq, and each solution
taken off it is *placed* — a store and a justification — before the next is realized. With
the clock as the only stamp, such a join would re-derive the network per solution and join
half of its bindings against a state the other half never saw. So the resident values are
**pinned** for the length of one agenda datum (`chain/process-datum`) and one backward
search step (`observe/with-search-scope`), and held fixed there. That is not an approximation of
the fixpoint, it *is* the fixpoint: an immediate-consequence step is by definition computed
from one state, and what a step enables is picked up by the next round rather than
mid-step. Outside such a scope there is nothing to hold fixed and the clock answers alone.

Residency is **not** conditional on a prover being registered. `qualitative-network` and
`possible-relations` are reads, and a network is a property of the stored facts whether or
not anybody opted in to reasoning with it.

`vaelii.impl.stp`'s metric network is resident on the same atom under a key of its own,
for the same reasons. So is the **join baseline** — but that one deliberately *outlives* a
clock tick, since its whole job is to say what has changed since a moment the clock has
long since moved past ([below](#the-re-join-is-semi-naive-over-the-pairs-that-moved)). It
is safe to lose and not safe to trust blindly: losing it costs a full re-join, so the
atom's own wholesale clearing and `core/clear!` need no special handling beyond dropping
it.

Each prover is **opt-in**, on top of a vocabulary that is itself a separate upper
context, and they are independent: register any, all, or none. A KB that loads the
vocabulary without a prover stores and retrieves the facts as ordinary facts, without
paying for a network:

```clojure
(v/add-reasoner kb :rcc8 :cardinal :allen)         ; topology, direction, intervals
(v/reasoners)                                      ; the roster, sorted
```

`add-reasoner` names them, so opting in needs nothing from `vaelii.impl.*` — the
provers themselves are impl values, and a subsystem only reachable past the public
boundary is one an embedding application cannot ask for. It resolves every name before
registering any (a typo registers nothing) and is idempotent per reasoner: sameness is
the prover **value**, since the six algebras share one record type and differ only in
the calculus they carry. `(v/reasoner :allen)` hands back the prover itself for a caller
assembling a registry of its own, and `add-prover` still takes any `Prover`.

## What a registered prover is reachable from

Registration puts the prover in the KB's own list, and several parts of the engine read
that list rather than the shipped default — so the reach is wider than "answers `ask`":

- **`ask` / `query-plan` / the level stack.** Level 6 (`:solved`) is the registry, so a
  qualitative goal is answered there.
- **Rule antecedents, backward.** A backward search discharges each antecedent through
  the registry at its leaf, so a rule can join on a relation the network entails and
  nobody stored.
- **`exceptWhen` and `unknown`.** Both evaluate at level 6, so a rule can state its
  exception as a qualitative goal — "birds fly, except when the bird is a proper part of
  the cage" works on a containment the network composed.

**Forward chaining too, on a relation nobody stored.** A forward rule's antecedents are
matched against stored facts, and an entailed relation is not one — it has no handle, so
on its own it gives a justification nothing to rest on, and a conclusion nothing can
withdraw is worse than a conclusion never drawn.

Support is what closes it, and the shape is smaller than materializing anything. The join
does not store the entailment; it contributes the **handles the entailment rests on**.
`chain/solve-qualitative` answers a qualitative antecedent by entailment and hands back
`support` as the firing's antecedent handles, so the conclusion is withdrawn when any
fact behind the entailment goes — the same contract an ordinarily matched antecedent has.
Nothing is materialized, so the O(n²) relations a network entails cost nothing until a
rule asks for one.

Three things follow, and each needed its own wiring:

- **The trigger index cannot see it.** A rule is fired by a datum whose predicate keys it,
  and a new `nonTangentialProperPart` fact licenses a `partOfRegion` antecedent — two
  predicates unrelated by `genl`, so the index would never connect them. A qualitative
  fact therefore re-joins every forward rule mentioning *any* predicate of its calculus,
  rather than firing one at a trigger position, since the arriving fact need not unify
  with the antecedent it enabled. Bounded by the rules that mention the calculus at all,
  and narrowed to the pairs that moved
  ([below](#the-re-join-is-semi-naive-over-the-pairs-that-moved)).
- **Union, not replacement.** The ordinary matcher still runs; entailment is added to it.
  Entailment subsumes assertion, but the two disagree at the edges — a literal whose
  arguments are not network nodes is outside the calculus — so nothing that fired before
  stops firing. Duplicate justifications from the two routes are set-deduped by the TMS.
- **An unsatisfiable network withdraws what it licensed**, and the justification's
  antecedents cannot say so. Adding a constraint only ever *narrows* what is possible, and
  narrowing makes a positive entailment more likely rather than less — so an entailment is
  never lost by learning more. What is lost is the right to use it, when the facts turn out
  unsatisfiable: the supporting facts are all still believed, and some *other* fact made
  the theory impossible. So such a firing is **blocked**, exactly as an `exceptWhen`-excepted
  one is (`chain/entailment-withdrawn?`, queued by `special/recheck-on-qualitative`), which
  means it is also *revived* by the same machinery when the clash is retracted.

Two things are deliberately left. The **diagonal** entails but supports nothing — the
algebra's identity makes `(partOfRegion ?x ?x)` true of every region with no stored fact
behind it — so it is dropped rather than answered with a groundless justification. And
support names *a* witness rather than every witness (above), so a relation reachable two
ways gets one justification; the second route is re-derived after a retraction rather than
having been recorded in advance.

#### Which networks it joins against

There is one network per **reader**, not one per context that holds a fact, and the
difference is the whole of `qcn-kb/reader-contexts`. A reader sees the entire
`genlCx` cone above it, so a context inheriting two contexts holds both their
facts in one network and composes what neither composes alone — `(ntpp A B)` in one and
`(ntpp B D)` in the other entail `A ⊏ D` for that reader and for nobody else. `ask` has
always answered there, because a query is asked *from* a context; a re-join has to be told
which contexts to stand in.

So the set is the fact-holding contexts **closed under where they meet** —
`taxonomy/meet-closure`, which is `maximal-common-descendant-contexts` over pairs to a
fixpoint, the same primitive placement uses ([contexts.md](contexts.md), where the
closure argument and its cost live; equality's migration is the other caller). A context
maximal for no subset costs one network read and cannot cost an answer here, because a
more specific reader sees a superset of the facts and narrowing only ever adds
entailments.

**A calculus whose facts are all in one context takes neither step**, which is every KB
that has not divided its spatial or temporal claims between contexts: with one fact
context there is nothing for a second to meet.

The same set answers a second question, which is why it lives in `qcn-kb` rather than in
the chainer. A goal whose context is a **variable** means "in some context", as it does
for every other prover, and it is answered by fanning the prover over the readers and
unioning their answers — never by reading every context's facts into one network, and
never by reading wherever happens to be convenient. [why the reader set is exact, not a
convenience](defenses.md#a-variable-context-goal-fans-over-readers-rather-than-reading-one-unioned-network)
The union network is still what `qcn-kb/network` returns for a variable context, and it is
a diagnostic view of everything stored rather than anything a reader sees; no goal is
answered off it. Placement is unaffected either way: a conclusion is placed from the
contexts of its support handles, so one solved at the meeting context lands there because
the facts that entailed it meet there.

### The re-join is semi-naive, over the pairs that moved

A qualitative fact cannot be matched at a trigger position, so every forward rule
mentioning its calculus is re-joined when one arrives. Joining over *every* pair the
network entails means the *n*th fact redoes the O(n²) work the (n−1)th already did — every
conclusion of it a duplicate justification the TMS dedups, correct and entirely wasted.

So the join runs over the **delta**: the pairs whose entailment has moved since these same
rules were last joined (`qcn-kb/join-delta`, `chain/rejoin-qualitative`). A pair that has
not moved licenses exactly the firings it licensed then, and those were derived then.

Three things make that sound rather than merely plausible.

**The baseline is the last *join*, not the last pass.** Those are different moments — a
query, or a settle's `entailment-withdrawn?` re-check, runs a pass without joining anything
— so the warm start's own seed set, which is exactly the delta against the last pass, is
deliberately *not* what is reported here. The baseline is recorded by the one caller that
re-joins all the rules at once, and by nothing else: a single rule's full join when that
rule arrives does not, or the next delta would claim the others were covered too.

**A moved constraint is not the only thing that moves a firing** — the handles behind it
count as well, and cannot be diffed pair by pair, since a derived support is a union along
whatever chain narrowed it and a handle swapped out at one pair moves the support at pairs
that did not themselves move. So that half is answered coarsely and from the input: if the
handle set the network was read out of has **lost** a member, the delta is `:all` and the
re-join is full. Losing one is what invalidates a justification and sweeps a conclusion,
which is the case that must be re-derived; gaining one only ever adds a second route to
something already believed. That is also the whole of retraction's story here, and the same
boundary the warm-started pass has: what a widening invalidated is not computable from the
answer it invalidated.

**One antecedent is narrowed, not all of them.** For a rule with two qualitative
antecedents, narrowing both at once would drop every firing pairing a moved binding with an
unmoved one. So the join runs once per qualitative antecedent, each time with a different
one narrowed — the delta rule, `Δ(A ⋈ B) = (ΔA ⋈ B) ∪ (A ⋈ ΔB)` — and the overlap
re-derives conclusions the TMS dedups.

What the narrowing does change is the **number of justifications**, and only downward. A
full re-join would record a fresh witness for a conclusion every time the support-carrying
pass happened to pick a different one, so a conclusion would accumulate alternate supports
as a side effect of redundant joining; the narrowed join records a subset of them. Belief
is identical either way — pair for pair, conclusion for conclusion, across a mid-load
retraction — and every conclusion keeps at least one justification. What the narrowing
drops is redundancy the stated contract never promised: support names *a* witness rather
than every witness ([above](#support-what-an-entailed-relation-rests-on)).

`qcn_integration_test` pins both halves separately, because "the conclusions are right" is
also what a delta that always answered `:all` would produce. Three tests compare an
interleaved load against a deferred one and against a KB that saw only the survivors of a
retraction — including the rule with two qualitative antecedents, and a second calculus,
since nothing here knows an algebra. Three more are about the delta itself: `:all` until a
baseline exists and empty immediately after one, `:all` again when a handle is retracted or
defeated out of the network, and empty in a sibling context the arriving fact is invisible
from. One counts what the join enumerated — thirteen regions in a chain entail 78 nested
pairs and an arrival answers at most 26 of them. And one grows a chain split across two
contexts a fact at a time, since the contexts a delta is taken for and the contexts
the join runs against have to be the same set.

Over the seam as a whole the guard is an **order oracle**, because every failure here is a
missing answer rather than a wrong one, and a KB that is merely less informative than it
should be reads as correct against anything except another order of the same content. So a
rule, four facts of mixed polarity, two contexts and the context below both are
asserted in eight seeded orders into a KB built from nothing each time — rules permuted
along with facts, since "the rule arrived last" is what a rule's own full join would
otherwise paper over — and every order must reach the identical derived set, placement
contexts included.

**Cost at load, measured.** None of this runs until a calculus prover is registered *and*
a forward rule mentions one of its predicates — registering a prover alone changes
nothing, which the numbers below confirm. Loading a containment chain of *n* regions, by
`lein bench-qcnchain`:

| regions | no prover | prover, no rule | prover + rule | deferred chaining |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 10 | 1.3 ms | 1.2 ms | 12 ms | 17 ms |
| 20 | 1.7 ms | 1.7 ms | 19 ms | 29 ms |
| 40 | 3.1 ms | 3.0 ms | 81 ms | 100 ms |
| 80 | 5.5 ms | 5.8 ms | 528 ms | 647 ms |

The cost grows faster than the input and slower than *n*³: 40 → 80 regions is 2× the
facts for 6.5× the time — super-quadratic (4× would be quadratic), sub-cubic.
Deferring the chaining is no penalty, because the one big datum it produces
joins over a delta like any other.

Three things hold that shape, and the order of them is the useful part. **The read is the
first half, and it is not the pass**: without residency a load pays a full network read
per consulting call — seventeen thousand of them against thirty-nine asserts at 40
regions, where the pass itself costs about a millisecond of the seventy an assert takes.
Residency takes those seventeen thousand to seventy-eight. **Then the pass**, which
warm-starts ([above](#warm-starting-semi-naive-over-the-network)). **Then the join**,
which is this section.

**The support-carrying pass is what none of that reaches**, and it is the one that cannot
warm-start. The plain pass costs a delta; the support pass runs whole, once per arriving
fact, because keeping the supports a previous run accumulated would make which handles a
firing rests on a function of arrival order. Counted at 80 regions it is 79 passes and
2.7 s against the warm-started plain pass's 78 and 0.4 s — the instrumentation inflates
both absolutes, so read the ratio, but nothing else in the load is near it.

**Carrying the support is not what makes it expensive.** Measured on the same network,
`path-consistent-with-support` costs **1.0–1.2×** what `path-consistent` costs — 1.01× on
the tree at every size, 1.10–1.18× on the total order. The union of handles at each
narrowing and the object array that holds them are a rounding error; what the support pass
pays for is the *tightening*, which it must redo from the raw network because supports
propagate only where a constraint moves. So it is not a pass that answers too many pairs,
it is a **cold** pass beside a warm one. Answering fewer pairs would buy the 10–20%;
answering them without a cold pass needs a support that is a function of the closed network
rather than of the propagation history, which is a different algorithm and an open one.

**Which shape a KB has decides all of this**, and the chain above is the worst one. The
same load over the branching-3 containment tree — the shape a mereology KB really produces,
where only pairs sharing an ancestor line compose:

| regions | no prover | prover, no rule | prover + rule | deferred chaining |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 20 | 1.5 ms | 1.4 ms | 7.1 ms | 14 ms |
| 40 | 2.5 ms | 2.7 ms | 20 ms | 23 ms |
| 80 | 5.1 ms | 5.8 ms | 64 ms | 48 ms |

**8.25× cheaper than the chain at 80 regions**, and it is the same code — the difference is
entirely how much of the network the facts pin. Both columns are worth having in view: the
chain says what the worst case costs, the tree says what a KB is likely to pay.
