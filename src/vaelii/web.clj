  justifications, all cross-linked.

  Public because it is a documented entry point — `lein browser`, or
  `lein run -m vaelii.web`.  The implementation is `vaelii.browser.web`, which is free to
  change; the dev-only affordances (`dev-repl`, `dev-stop`) stay there.

  It binds loopback and authenticates nobody; read `.github/SECURITY.md` before
  `--listen` names an address."

;; ---- extensions ---------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; A library adds pages and panels to the browser by registering an extension; the
;; browser names no extension.  A handler receives `view` — the value the browser builds
;; per request, opaque but for `:kb` (the KB it reads) and `:sandbox` (this session's
;; scratch context) — and renders with the helpers below.  docs/web.md, "Extensions".

(defn register-extension
  "File `ext` under `ext-name`, a lower-case keyword, replacing any extension of that
  name; answers the name.  Keys, all optional: `:routes` (under `/ext/<name>/`, methods
  `:get` `:post` `:write`, each `(fn [view req] …)`), `:term-panel`
  (`(fn [view term] …)`), `:on-start` (`(fn [])`), `:stylesheet` and `:script`
  (classpath resources).  `vaelii.browser.web/register-extension` has the contract."
