  "Koinii cross-seat dereference: the DISTRIBUTED topology, where
  independent *seats* — separate processes, each holding its own copy of the KB — stay
  in sync by **content-addressed commits** rather than by sharing one live daemon.  A
  seat asserts a sentence and commits; another seat pulls the same commit and resolves
  the same sentence **from its own KB**.  The locator travels over a transport; the
  proof comes from the KB, and neither seat trusts the marker.

  A different deployment shape from koinii's default (N agents funnelling writes through
  one single-writer daemon — `docs/koinii.md`, *The deployment shape*).  There the
  daemon IS the shared KB and dereference is a plain read; here each seat is its own
  reader with its own store, and the shared reference point is a commit, not a socket.
  Complements, not rivals: the daemon for live co-writing, this for disconnected or
  independently-replicated seats.

  The spike's vocabulary, mapped to real primitives:

  - **seat** — an independent KB-holding process.  In this layer a seat is just a `kb`;
    every function takes one, exactly as the other koinii modules do.
  - **locator / marker** — a content-addressed reference to a canonical assertion (the
    `locator`), plus the untrusted transport payload that carries it (the `marker`).
  - **transport** — any byte-faithful channel that carries a marker.  A marker is a
    plain Clojure map, so any transport that ships EDN ships one.
  - **the KB** — the sole authority for *meaning*.  A marker is never trusted, only
    resolved: `dereference` finds the sentence in the seat's own store, reads its
    provenance, and hands off to `why` for the proof.

  Three ideas, each grounded on a primitive that ships:

  - **The locator is content-addressed, not handle-addressed.**  A handle is a number
    one store minted and does not travel; a locator is a **self-describing** digest — the
    literal `\"sha256:\"` followed by 64 lowercase hex chars — over a sentex's **canonical
    identity** (its context, polarity, and canonicalized sentence,
    `docs/canonicalization.md`).  Three best-practice commitments live in that one string:
      * **SHA-256, not SHA-1.**  A locator is a tamper-detection boundary — `dereference`
        rehashes the *resolved* form and compares — and SHA-1 has practical chosen-prefix
        collisions, so it is the wrong primitive for this job.
      * **Self-describing.**  The `\"sha256:\"` multihash-style tag names the algorithm in
        the value itself, so a later migration to another primitive is unambiguous rather
        than a silent reinterpretation of 64 anonymous hex chars.
      * **A spec'd canonical encoding, not `pr-str`.**  The digest input is the explicit,
        type-tagged, self-delimiting byte encoding `vaelii.core/digest` hashes — independent of
        ambient `*print-*` vars and injective across the value space a sentence holds, so
        a symbol never digests as the like-spelled string and `(a b)` never as `(a (b))`.
    Two seats holding the same assertion compute the **same** locator, because `v/import!`
    re-canonicalizes every record through the reading build's own constructor.
  - **The commit is a Merkle function of belief.**  `commit-id` is the RFC-6962-style
    **Merkle root** over the seat's *sorted* per-sentex leaf digests — leaf hashing
    domain-separated with a `0x00` byte and internal-node hashing with `0x01`, so a leaf
    can never be forged as an internal node — prefixed `\"sha256:\"`.  The leaves are the
    records the seat **believes**, not everything it stores: a defeated default is retained
    on purpose and is no part of what the seat holds, so two seats that agree on every
    belief compute one id however differently their stores were built.  Order- and
    handle-independent, so two seats that reached the same beliefs by different routes
    compute the same commit id (belief and storage are order-independent —
    `docs/nmtms.md`), and a KB exported, pulled and recovered on another seat carries the
    id across.  A sentence that names a sentex by `(sentexHandle n)` — every koinii
    response act — digests the named record's own identity in place of `n`
    (`v/digest`), so a reply is located by its target and two seats that built one
    conversation in different orders agree on it.  The Merkle shape buys pure auditability:
    `inclusion-proof` yields an audit path and `verify-inclusion` recomputes the root from
    just a `(locator, proof)` pair — no KB — which a flat digest cannot.  `commit-id` fingerprints **knowledge** (what two seats compare to agree they
    hold the same thing); `state-root` is a second root whose leaves fold each record's
    provenance (`:creator` + `:created` + identity), a full **snapshot** identity like a
    git commit (covers who/when), so it moves when provenance moves even when content does
    not.  `publish!` / `pull!` move the bytes (via `v/export!` / `v/import!`); the roots
    are what say two seats hold the same knowledge (and the same snapshot).
  - **The marker is untrusted.**  `dereference` finds the sentence in the seat's own KB
    and rehashes what it found; a stale or tampered marker fails that check and is
    rejected, and a marker the seat cannot resolve means the commit was not received —
    never that the marker's payload should be believed.  Resolution is scoped to BELIEF
    for the reason the commit is: a record the seat stores but does not believe is no part
    of what it holds, so `dereference` declines it exactly as `inclusion-proof` declines to
    prove it.  A locator alone resolves nothing: the marker's sentence and context find the
    record, and the locator checks it.  `dereference` also **fails closed on a malformed
    payload**, as `verify-inclusion` does on a malformed proof: a marker that is not a
    map, whose `:locator` is not this format, or whose sentence the engine declines to be
    asked about is ANSWERED `:malformed` rather than allowed to throw the engine's
    refusal out of the resolve path — a peer must not be able to crash a receiving seat by
    sending garbage.  Attribution is trustworthy only as far as the identity model makes
    it: a distributed KB inherits the same cooperative-vs-proof-tier question.

  Additive, like the other koinii modules: only the public core API — the record walk
  is `handles` / `sentex`, and the locator is `digest` / `digests`, so a seat digests
  what the store itself would.  Beside it, koinii `types`.  Nothing under
  `vaelii.impl`, and nothing in core loads it."

  stored before an `argIsa` was declared would fail it while the seat holds and believes
  that record.  So ask the entry point the resolution goes through: where `handle-of`

    answered, never allowed to throw out of the resolve path.  Distinct from
    `:not-received`: one peer is out of sync, the other sends garbage.
  - `:not-received`: the sentence is not in this seat's store; the marker's payload is not
    trusted instead.
  - a target's reason, with `:target` naming the sender's handle number: a `:targets` record
    this seat does not resolve, or a malformed target marker (`local-handle`).  A `:targets`
    value that is not a map of integers to markers, or a chain deeper than
    `max-target-depth`, is `:malformed` with `:problem :targets`.
  - `:not-believed`: the sentence is stored and not believed (`docs/nmtms.md`).  The record
    has no leaf in the `commit-id` tree, so resolving it would hand back a record the seat
    can produce no proof of.
  - `:locator-mismatch`: stored and believed, but the locator this seat computes differs:
