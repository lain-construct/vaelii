  "Koinii belief projection and own-statement disregard — reasoning about what agents
  hold, built on modal belief projection (`vaelii.impl.modal`, `docs/belief.md`) and
  `except` visibility masking.

  Two capabilities, and a boundary between them that matters:

  - **Projection — read what an agent holds.**  `(believes agent P)` proves `P` in the
    agent's OWN context (`CxAgent<agent>`), never the asker's, so agents may
    hold contradictory beliefs without the KB contradicting itself, and asking what one
    agent believes never pulls in another's.  `believe-own` links an agent's belief
    context to its koinii write context, so it believes what it asserted and endorsed.
    This is the whole cross-agent story: you ask what an agent holds *from that agent's
    own context* — you never merge one agent's beliefs into another (a cross-agent
    `genlCx` would, and would drag one agent's contradictions into the other).

  - **Disregard — an agent reversibly withdraws its OWN statement.**  `disregard` puts
    an `(except (sentexHandle H))` in the agent's own context, hiding `H` for reads and
    derivations, reversibly (`restore!`), without deleting it.  It is restricted to the
    agent's own statements **by construction**, and that restriction is the point:
    `except` is an **index-layer** mask — it removes a sentex from *view* — so using it
    across agents (agent B hiding agent A's claim) would make a common-descendant context
    unable to *argue*: argumentation needs both a claim and its rebuttal visible so the
    TMS can weigh them, and an index-layer removal takes the claim out of view entirely.
    Cross-agent disagreement is therefore `dispute` / argue (speech-acts + adjudication), which
    keeps both sides visible; `except` is only ever an agent editing the visibility of
    what it *itself* said.

  Additive, like the other koinii modules: only the public core API plus koinii
  `identity` — nothing under `vaelii.impl`, and nothing in core loads it."

  (read with `disagreements`).

  The constructive complement to projection: agent belief contexts share no ancestor, so
  contradictory beliefs coexist silently (`docs/belief.md`); this convenes a common
  descendant on demand, and contradiction detection — scoped to what a context sees —
  raises the clash the moment the edges land.  (This is also why `disregard` is

  deliberately not `target_following_predicate`).

  **Own statements only, enforced.**  `except` is an index-layer visibility mask, so
  hiding *another* agent's claim would take it out of view where argumentation needs it
  visible — a common-descendant context could no longer weigh the claim against its
