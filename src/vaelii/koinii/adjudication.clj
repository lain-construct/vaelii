  "Koinii adjudication — the DEFAULT policy: leave-open-and-notify, plus the
  lifecycle that keeps disputes from piling up, plus the two escalations (a named
  arbiter's ruling, and a counted majority).  A thin CLIENT
  wrapper over the dispute reads (`vaelii.koinii.dispute`) — it touches no
  engine internals and changes belief only through ordinary asserts / retracts.

  koinii's first answer to a disagreement is NOT to pick a winner.  When two agents
  assert P and ¬P at `:default`, the KB stays **paraconsistent** — both coexist, `argue`
  reports `:contradiction` (Priest's LP) — and this layer just records the dispute open,
  pushes it to whoever is watching, and manages its life.  Automatic resolution by source
  trust is a harder, engine-side policy; do not reach for it here.

  Three policies, one default (koinii.md, *Adjudication: split by policy*), and all three
  are here:

  - **Leave-open-and-notify** *(the default)* — record open, notify, change no
    belief.  Correct for a ground truth people curate.
  - **Arbiter escalation** — a designated arbiter's ruling is an
    ordinary `:monotonic` assertion of the upheld side; its strength defeats the losing
    `:default` side, so the clash clears, `why` explains who ruled, and retracting the
    ruling reopens the dispute (cascading).
  - **Majority vote** — the ballots cast on the disputed claim are counted and the side
    with strictly more is upheld, through that same reversible ruling; a tie upholds
    nothing, so an evenly-split house stays open.

  **Trust-resolve** — automatic resolution by source trust — is out of scope for this
  layer: it is engine-side reputation work, and reaching for it here would resolve
  disagreements by weighing spoofable identities.

  The dispute module owns the reads, the state vocabulary, and the dispute id; THIS module owns the policy
  the dispute module deliberately left out — the **clock**, the **timeout**, and the **notify sinks**.  The
  clock is the engine clock (`v/*clock*`), so a lifecycle time and its assertion's
  `:created` provenance agree.

  Additive, like the sibling koinii modules: only the public core API — including
  `sort-by-content` for the two content orders it reports (`contested-premises`,
  `standing-rulings`) — plus koinii `dispute`, `identity` and `types`.  Nothing in core loads it."

  "The disputed premises the conclusion `S` rests on in `ctx`: the handles in S's support
  closure that are a side of an open dispute `ctx` observes.  Empty if S rests on nothing
  contested.  A pure read that changes no belief (unlike `quarantine`): an open dispute does
  not block dependent reasoning, so a conclusion resting on a contested premise should be
  *visible as such*.

  **Scoped to the ANCESTOR SET.**  `S` is every believed sentex of `S` in a context `ctx`
  sees (`v/sees?`), the scoping `disputes-in` and `ask?` use: forward chaining places a
  conclusion in the most specific context that sees its premises, an AGENT's context
  rather than the channel's, so an exact-context lookup would answer 'nothing contested' for
  a conclusion built on a disputed claim.  **Every visible derivation**: where more than one
  context holds `S`, their support closures are UNIONED, so no tie-break depends on seq
  order or handles.  **Belief-filtered**: a defeated stored sentex holds up no answer.
  **Content-ordered** by the premise's `[sentence context]` (`v/sort-by-content`); the
  context is required since the union can hold one sentence in two agents' contexts."

  Scoped to `channel`: the claim stays believed in its OWN context.  It OVER-SUPPRESSES:
  `channel` can no longer see the dispute (`argue` there reads the lone surviving side), and
  `except` interacts with the TMS and contexts.  Prefer `contested-premises` /
  `rests-on-contested?` unless a channel must exclude contested claims from derivation.
