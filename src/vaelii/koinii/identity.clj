  "Koinii actor identity: per-agent contexts as the identity substrate AND the
  write boundary, an admin-only agent registry, and the one auth extension point whose strength
  is conditional on the adjudication policy.

  The engine deliberately pushes per-caller identity OUT — `*creator*` is an
  unauthenticated annotation and the daemon's only auth is one shared bearer token —
  so koinii's answer is the context lattice, not a new auth subsystem:

  - **An agent IS its context.**  Atlas writes into `CxAtlas`, lifted under the
    channel by `(genlCx CxDeploy CxAtlas)`.  A reader of `CxDeploy` sees the union of
    every agent's assertions; `CxAtlas` alone is 'everything Atlas said' — a plain
    context read.  Because context is part of sentex identity, Atlas's `P` and
    Boreas's `P` are two DISTINCT sentexes, each with its own creator, so
    first-writer-wins loses no co-source (`co-attribution-survives?`).
  - **The write boundary is 'your own context, and nothing else.'**  That is the one
    enforcement point identity needs, and it is why the registry context is the one
    context agents may NOT write — the governed may not write the authority that
    governs them.

  The auth extension point is conditional on policy (koinii design D4):

  - **Cooperative** (the default) — `*creator*` bound by convention, the write routed
    to the agent's own context, trusted because the agents are.  Correct for a
    notify-only deployment.  It defends fat-fingers, NOT attackers: `authenticate`
    trusts the claimed id with no proof, so a client may claim any identity.  State
    plainly that identity is unauthenticated here.
  - **Proof-tier** — REQUIRED the moment trust-resolve is enabled, because
    trust-weighting a spoofable identity is worse than no trust.  `authenticate`
    verifies a credential (the `verify-fn` extension point — sign-at-ingest, an authenticating
    proxy, or A2A AgentCards / DIDs) and REFUSES an unverified request; `ingest` under
    the principal it mints attests each write with the deployment key (`*attest-key*`).
    Both checks run in the process that holds the key, never on the wire.

  Every write goes through the provenance-stamping `assert` path — NEVER
  `bulk-assert-facts!`, which binds `*bulk-load?*` and writes no provenance at all."

  **Why a written fact rather than a shape read off the lattice.**  `context-for` maps
  `AgentAtlas` to `CxAtlas` by dropping a prefix, so an agent context is spelled exactly
  like a channel and no name tells them apart; and the placement EDGES do not either,
  because `(genlCx ?parent ctx)` and `(genlCx ctx ?root)` are the ordinary wiring of any
  nested context — the same two edges under a channel rolled up into a wider one.
  Inferring the role from them makes admission a function of what else has landed and of
  which vocabulary a placement rooted at, which is order dependence in an entry point.  A
  positive stored fact is neither: it is written once by whoever placed the context, it
  reads the same however the rest of the lattice grew, and every koinii placement route
  writes it.

  It lands in the agent's OWN context, which is the one context D8 already says the agent
  writes — so recording it needs no privilege the agent does not have, and no agent can

  the context and lands in it.  Returns the agent context symbol.

  **The three writes in one place, and `write!` is what lets them be.**  A channel writes

  **Why this rather than `first`.**  `sentexes-matching` answers with the *set* of
  matches and promises nothing about the order they come back in, so a bare `first` over
  two rows names whichever the index enumerated — which is the order the registry was
  written in.  The trust a read reports, and the row an overwrite retracts, would then
  depend on the write order rather than on what the registry holds.

  `trustLevel` and `displayNameOf` are declared `functional`
  (`resources/kb/koinii/CxRegistry.txt`), and the koinii writers retract a value before
  writing its successor.  A second value written beside the first is stored, and the
  settle decides the pair: a second value at the first's class is a dilemma and both
