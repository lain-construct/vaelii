  "The change feed with a **cursor** where the in-process one has a callback — the
  daemon-side state a remote caller holds a feed open against.

  `core/watch` takes a function, and a function does not cross an EDN wire (the same
  wall `:export`'s `:on-progress` hits).  So the wire's half of the feed is not the
  callback marshalled somehow; it is the one thing a request/response protocol can
  carry, which is **state with a cursor**: the daemon registers an ordinary listener of
  its own, that listener files each event into a bounded ring, and a caller reads the
  ring forward from where it left off.  Three ops — register, read, drop — every one of
  them EDN in and EDN out, so the guards, the client and the error taxonomy that already
  exist carry it unchanged (docs/operations.md).

  **A cursor counts events, not handles.**  It starts at 0 when the subscription is
  registered and advances by one per delivered event, so a caller compares nothing and
  stores one integer.  `poll` answers the events past the cursor it was handed and the
  cursor to send next time.

  **The ring is bounded, and falling off it is said out loud.**  A subscriber that stops
  reading must not grow the daemon's heap, so the ring keeps `max-events` and drops the
  oldest past it — and the *count* of what it dropped is reported as `:lagged` on the
  next poll.  That number is the whole reason this is usable: a feed with a silent gap
  is strictly worse than polling, because the caller believes it is current and is not.
  `:lagged` is present on every reply, zero and all, so a client that forgets to read it
  is a client that cannot have one.

  **A token that names no subscription is refused, never answered empty.**  The same
  argument: a reaped, dropped or invented token answering `{:events []}` is a feed that
  has silently stopped.  `:unknown-subscription` says so.

  **What a subscription costs the daemon, and what bounds it.**  One listener on the
  KB's feed and one ring of at most `max-events` events; `max-subscriptions` of those at
  once, and one that nobody has polled inside `idle-ms` is reaped at the next call.
  Nothing here authenticates the caller — that is the bearer token's job, one layer out
  (`vaelii.impl.serve`) — but heap a stranger can allocate wants a ceiling whether or
  not it is authenticated, and the reap is what keeps an abandoned subscription from
  holding a slot against a live one.

  **The wait happens here, outside the daemon's monitor.**  A long poll parks on the
  subscription's own signal object, so a writer serialized behind `serve`'s one monitor
  runs to completion while a poll is parked — the feature is about liveness, and a
  parked poll that blocked every writer would be a global stall wearing its name.  The
  writing thread's only cost is the swap that files the event and a `notifyAll` on a
  monitor no poller holds for longer than a compare.

  The three entry points are spelled without `!` for `core/watch`'s reason: nothing here
  destroys stored knowledge (docs/api.md).  See docs/feed.md, \"Across the wire\"."

(def max-subscriptions
  "How many live subscriptions one daemon holds at once.  Reached, a further `watch` is
  refused (`:too-many-subscriptions`) rather than evicting somebody else's: a
  subscription silently dropped is the silent gap this whole namespace exists to
  refuse, and the caller that gets the refusal is the one that can still do something
  about it."
  64)

(def max-events
  "How many events one subscription's ring retains.  Past it the oldest goes and the
  drop is counted, so the depth is the slack a reader has between polls rather than a
  promise it cannot fall behind.  Reported by `watch`, since it is the number a poll
  interval is chosen against."
  256)

(def max-wait-ms
  "The longest a long poll parks before answering, whatever `:wait-ms` asks for.  A
  parked poll holds a server thread, so the ceiling is on the daemon's threads rather
  than on the caller's patience — a caller wanting to wait longer polls again, which
  costs it one round trip and costs the daemon nothing it was not already paying."
  30000)

(def max-parked
  "How many long polls may be **parked at once** on one daemon.

  A parked poll holds an HTTP worker thread for the length of its wait, so the ceiling
  that matters here is the server's thread pool rather than anything this namespace owns:
  park more polls than the pool has threads and the daemon answers nothing at all —
  `/health`, a write, another caller's read — until one of them times out.  Moving the
  wait outside `serve`'s monitor is what keeps a parked poll from blocking the *writer*;
  it does nothing about the *threads*, and the two are separate ceilings.

  So this one is deliberately well under `vaelii.impl.serve/http-threads`, and
  `serve_test` pins that relationship rather than trusting the two numbers to stay
  related.  Over it, a poll asking to wait is **refused** (`:too-many-waiters`) rather
  than parked: the caller is told to poll on a timer instead, which costs the daemon one
  request and no held thread, and is the same feed at a worse latency.  Answering it an
  immediate empty page would be the cheaper lie — the caller would see a long poll that
  never waits and a latency it has no way to explain."
  16)

(def idle-ms
  "How long a subscription survives with nobody polling it.  A client that goes away
  without saying so leaves a listener and a ring behind; without this they hold a slot
  against a live caller until the daemon restarts.  Reaped lazily, at the next `watch`
  or `poll`, so nothing here needs a thread of its own."

  subscription is refused rather than landing on somebody else's — `feed/register!`'s
