  "Koinii speech-acts: the small vocabulary of moves agents make, as
  sentexes in the KB.  A move is not an out-of-band message but knowledge — queryable,
  retractable, auditable like any other fact — and the SHAPE of the move carries the
  layer's headline property (koinii design D1 / D5).

  Two kinds of move, one split (`koinii.md`, *Reply is an assertion*):

  - **Origination** (`asserts`, `queries`) — a plain assertion in the acting agent's
    own context.  The claim, or the query node, plus its provenance IS the act: nothing
    wraps it, because provenance already records who spoke (first-writer-wins).  So an
    assertion in koinii is just an assertion — `assert-claim` mints no `asserts` edge.
    A query is minted as a node (`pose-query`), because a question must be told apart
    from a claim.
  - **Response** (`answers`, `disputes`, `endorses`, `justifies`) — a META-SENTEX on
    the target sentex, naming it by handle `(sentexHandle H)`, asserted in the
    RESPONDER's own context and stamped with the responder as creator.  Each response
    predicate is declared `targetFollowingPredicate` in `CxSpeechActs`, so retracting a
    target sweeps its replies with it (`core/retract-following-metas!`).  Two facts
    force this: the cascade needs BOTH the meta-sentex AND the mark (an unmarked meta
    orphans harmlessly), and first-writer-wins forces each act to be its own object —
    two endorsers are two sentexes with two creators, never one re-assert.

  `retracts` is the engine's `retract!` on a handle.  The error acts
  (`notUnderstood`, `refuse`) name the received edge, in the refusing agent's context,
  and are deliberately unmarked.  This layer only REPRESENTS the moves; adjudication is
  a separate layer.

  Additive, like the sibling koinii modules: requires only the public core API and koinii
  `identity` — nothing under `vaelii.impl`, and nothing in core loads it.  Every write goes
  through the provenance-stamping `assert` path, never `bulk-assert-facts!`."

  the agent speaks the act vocabulary and the rules over it fire.  Both edges are
  monotonic topology.  Returns the agent context symbol.

  This is the identity substrate acts land in: 'who' comes from the edge's own context
  and provenance, never from the target it names."
