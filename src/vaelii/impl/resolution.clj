(def ^:dynamic *arg-root-retrieval*
  "Whether `match-one` may retrieve its candidate handles from a **secondary argument
  root** instead of always walking the trie.

  The trie narrows strictly left to right, so a pattern whose *first* argument is a
  variable but a later argument is a ground term — `(parentOf ?x Tom)`, the second
  half of a grandparent join — cannot be answered by a prefix: the trie fans out over
  every first-argument value (one lookup per node) only to keep the few
  that match the later token.  The argument-root node `[pred pos term]` indexes exactly
  that later position under the pattern's own predicate, so it answers the same pattern
  with one read per context the node lists (one, for a ground pattern context).

  When several arguments are known, `candidate-handles` intersects the pattern's
  scoped argument roots (`sentexes-with-args` — the scoping means a named functor
  needs no predicate-extent intersection), so knowing more of the sentence narrows on all
  of it at once instead of one column.
  The set it returns is a **superset** of the trie's hits — `match-one`'s existing
  `unify` filters it to the identical result (the trie's own hit set *is* the
  unifiable set, and the roots' intersection ⊇ that).  So this changes only *how* the
  candidates are fetched, never *which* sentexes match.  Binding it false forces the
  trie, which is what `arg_root_retrieval_test` compares against.  True by default — a
  strict improvement on the after-a-variable case and a no-op everywhere else."
  true)

(def ^:dynamic *structural-index*
  "Whether `candidate-handles` may use the **structural trie** to narrow a positive
  pattern with a nested compound argument — `(mass ?o (QuantityFn ?n Kilogram))`.

  A positive fact's key linearizes its compound arguments into the trie path (see
  `vaelii.impl.sentex`), so `QuantityFn` and `Kilogram` sit at their own trie levels
  and `p/lookup` narrows on them even when the top-level argument is a
  partially-variable compound — the one case the argument roots (top-level only) and
  the flat trie both leave to a full functor-extent fan.  On (default), that pattern
  is answered by the structural trie; off, by the **functor extent** — a correct
  superset the existing `unify` filters to the identical set, and the conservative
  baseline the structural selectivity is measured against (`structural_index_test`,
  modeled on `arg_root_retrieval_test`).

  The structural key is written unconditionally, so the direct `p/lookup` paths
  (`find-sentex-handle`, the level-0 raw lookup) always walk it; `query` and the
  matching levels go through `candidate-handles`, so this gates *their* candidate
  source too — never correctness: on and off return the same matches, on returns fewer
  candidates.  Negative and flat patterns are untouched — a `:false` key keeps its
  body whole, so it has no deep positions to narrow on.

  On by default: the oracle (`structural_index_test`) proves on == off over the
  corpus, and the structural retrieval is a strict candidate-set win on a
  compound-argument pattern (2 candidates vs the functor extent), so there is no
  reason to prefer the looser fallback."

  context when that is ground, every context (nil) when it is a variable."

(defn- candidate-handles
  "The stored handles to unify `pat` against — always a superset of the positional
  trie hits (so `match-one`'s `unify` filters it to the identical set), chosen to
  minimize index lookups.

  The trie narrows only left to right, so it is at its best when the *ground*
  arguments form a left prefix — `(parentOf Tom ?y)`, `(parentOf Tom Bob)` — and at
  its worst when a ground argument sits **after** a variable, `(parentOf ?x Tom)` or
  `(rel A ?y C)`, which it can reach only by fanning out over the intervening
  variable (a round trip per value).  For exactly that case the secondary roots are a
  *different* index order that pins the stuck position directly, and — the point of
  this refinement — intersecting **every** ground argument's predicate-scoped root
  narrows on all the known terms at once (`sentexes-with-args`: one hash lookup when a
  single argument is bound, an intersection when several are) rather than picking one
  column and deferring the rest to a per-record filter.  So knowing more of the
  sentence buys a tighter candidate set, not just the same one.

  **The functor is a position too.**  `(?type Muffet)` — what types does Muffet hold —
  is the same shape at level 0: the variable is the *first* path token, so every
  ground argument sits behind it and the trie can only fan out over the whole root
  child set, i.e. every functor in the KB.  That fan is linear in the vocabulary,
  which is the largest thing in a broad ontology.  The predicate-agnostic read spans
  every functor by construction — a union of the scoped roots over the slot roster —
  so one `sentexes-with-arg` read of position 1, `Muffet` answers it flat; with no
  predicate to scope by, `sentexes-with-args` takes a `nil` `pred` and intersects
  those predicate-agnostic reads.

  A positive pattern with a **nested compound argument** is the third source: its
  selective information sits *inside* the compound (`QuantityFn`, `Kilogram`), which
  neither a left prefix nor a top-level argument root reaches.  The structural trie
  narrows on it (`*structural-index*`); off, it falls back to the functor extent — a
  correct superset, and the baseline to measure the structural narrowing against.

  **The context is a position too, and the trie's last.**  `(parentOf Tom ?y)` in a
  ground context `C` has a left prefix, but the trie walk fans over every stored `?y`
  under `[parentOf Tom]`, in every context, before it reaches the context level.  The
  argument roots end in the context, so a pattern whose arguments are variables and
  indexable terms, at least one of each, reads the nodes' leaves in `C` alone
  (`ctx-scope`): its candidates are the matches stored in `C`, not those stored
  anywhere.  A pattern whose arguments are all variables reads the predicate extent's
  leaf in `C` (`:context-extent`), for the same reason.

  Everything else keeps the trie: a fully-ground test (its leaf is exact), a pattern
  whose ground arguments are a left prefix under a variable context, and a pattern whose
  only after-a-variable selectivity is a **non-indexable** token (a number/string the
  roots do not key), where the trie's own token narrowing beats a predicate-extent scan.
  Zero-regression by construction — the diverted cases are the ones the trie answers
  with a fan-out.

  **The decision is named before it is taken.**  The `cond` below yields one of seven
  keywords and the `case` under it does the read, so the access path a shape chose is a
  value: `vaelii.impl.profile` tallies it, and a reader has a word for each branch rather
  than a position in a `cond`."

(defn match1
  "Unify a single antecedent pattern against a ground fact sentence, honoring
  **predicate specificity**: a fact whose functor is a *spec* (sub-predicate, via the
  genl closure) of the antecedent's functor satisfies it, with the arguments unified.

  For a unary type antecedent this is the ordinary subtype rule — `(animal ?x)` is met
  by `(dog Muffet)`.  Generalized to n-ary predicates, `(parentOf ?x ?y)` is met by
  `(fatherOf Tom Bob)` once `(genl fatherOf parentOf)` holds — the same subsumption the
  type hierarchy gives, applied to the predicate hierarchy.  When the functors are
  equal (the common case) or the antecedent's functor has no sub-predicates, this is a
  plain unify, so nothing changes for a KB without predicate-genl edges.

  **Under a negation the fan reverses**, because a `genl` edge carries the other way
  through one: `dog ⊑ animal` makes `(dog Muffet)` satisfy `(animal ?x)` and makes
  `(not (animal Muffet))` satisfy `(not (dog ?x))` — the contrapositive, so a negated
  antecedent is met by a negative fact on a **genl** of its body's predicate.  The two
  directions are exclusive: `(not (dog Muffet))` does not satisfy `(not (animal ?x))`,
  which is the reading a fan in the positive direction would give it.  Both sides must
  be negations for this to apply; a negation matched against a positive fact fails on
  polarity as it does anywhere else.

  **The subsumption is scoped when a `context` is given**: the predicate-genl closure is
  walked only through the edges that context can see, so a match reached through a `genl`
  edge stated in a context the reader cannot see is not a match for it — a watcher in one
  context stops answering through another's edge (`core/watch-match`), agreeing with what
  `ask` from that context would say.  The two-arity is unscoped, for the callers that fix
  visibility elsewhere: the forward trigger match (`chain/fire-rules-for`) is a candidate
  filter whose placement re-derives the genlCx supporters the firing then rests on, so a
  subsumption invisible to the placement context drops out at placement, not here."

  the genl closure) of the goal's functor still answers the goal, so its argument
  lists unify and the goal variable binds to the more specific instance.  This is the
  backward dual of `match1` — where a subtype *fact* satisfies a supertype antecedent,
  here a subtype *conclusion* satisfies a supertype goal.

  Equal functors (the common case), a variable goal functor, or a functor with no
  sub-predicates all fall through to a plain `unify` over the whole sentences, so
  nothing changes for a KB without predicate-genl edges, and a rule concluding a
  *supertype* or an unrelated predicate is correctly rejected (the functors do not
  unify).

  **Under a negation the fan reverses**, exactly as it does in `match1`: a rule
  concluding `(not (animal ?x))` answers the goal `(not (dog Tom))`, because `dog ⊑
  animal` entails `¬animal ⊑ ¬dog`.  Both sides must be negations; a negated goal
  against a positive consequent falls through to the plain `unify`, which rejects it on
  the functor.

  **Scoped in lockstep with `match1`** (its forward twin): with a `context`, the
  predicate-genl closure is walked only through the edges that context can see.  The
  backward callers already scope the *candidate rule set* upstream
  (`concluding-rule-handles … context`, via `provers/candidate-rules`), which reads the
  same scoped closure — so passing the context here changes no answer today, and keeps
  a future caller that skips that filter from subsuming through an invisible edge.  The

  concluding a subtype answers a supertype goal, the backward dual of `fire-rules-for`
  fanning a new fact over its supertypes.  Computed as the intersection `specs(pred) ∩
  rules-by-consequent`: iterate the spec closure and probe the consequent index.  A
  non-symbol `pred` cannot be a type, so it degrades to the plain lookup.

  **Plus the variable-consequent catch-all.**  A rule concluding `(?p ?y ?x)` files its
  consequent under `p/var-consequent-key` rather than under any concrete predicate (see
  `rules/consequent-index-pred`), and could conclude *any* predicate once `?p` binds — so
  its bucket is unioned into every answer.  Without it a goal on `likes` never discovers
  a rule concluding `(?p …)`, and backward chaining is blind to exactly the rules the
  consequent-var-pred feature exists to make reachable.

  **A variable `pred` is the dual**: the goal `(?p Tom ?y)` names no consequent bucket
  and any rule may conclude it, `subsuming-unify` binding `?p` to the consequent's
  functor.  So it answers **every** rule stated where `visible` reaches, read off the
  rule extent (`reads/as-stored-rules-in`).  Paid only for a variable functor, which
  fact matching already answers through the argument roots; without it the open functor
  reached stored facts and silently no rule.

  **The answer is bounded by the concluding rules; the cost is bounded by the taxonomy.**
  One index probe per spec, so a goal on a type with 364 subtypes takes 364 probes to
  discover that no rule concludes any of them — and `provers/shadowing-channels` asks
  this once per goal, on the path `sole-prover` takes.  Cheap per probe and never a
  record fetch, but it is the spec closure that sizes it, not the rule count.

  With a `context`, the spec fan walks only the genl edges visible from it — a rule
  concluding a subtype answers a supertype goal exactly where the subtype edge is
  visible, mirroring the matching fan-out.  With `visible` as well, a context set, every
  index read returns only the rules stated in one of those contexts: both rule indexes
  end in the context, so a rule stated where the reader cannot see is never read."

  before: no chunking, no hint, one `get-sentex` per candidate that survives the belief
  filter.

  Turned on, a walk takes its candidates a chunk at a time and tells the store which
  handles the chunk is about to ask for, so a store that can answer many at one cost
  (`protocols/Prefetching`) may do that instead of being asked one at a time.  Nothing
  about the result moves: the hint returns nothing and every record still arrives through
  `get-sentex`, so this is a cost setting and never a semantic one.

  **It is off because it is only ever worth it over a fetch that is not local.**  On the
  RAM and disk record stores no store implements the capability, so the hint would have
  nobody to give it to; over a networked store it is worth it exactly when the candidates
  are not already cached, which the store itself checks — so turning this on hands the
  decision to the party that can make it, rather than making it here.  The evidence that
  says to turn it on is a `:fetches` tally (`vaelii.impl.profile`) large against a query's
  wall clock on a corpus whose working set does not fit that store's cache.

  The chunk is the unit of over-fetch: a consumer that takes one solution and stops has
  hinted at most this many handles, so a large chunk amortizes better and wastes more.

  sorted (see `vaelii.impl.sentex`), so the fan is what makes lookup order-insensitive:
  it retrieves `(siblingOf Ann Carol)` from the pattern `(siblingOf ?x Carol)` or
  `(siblingOf Carol ?x)` alike, and keeps a fact reachable even if it was asserted
  before its `symmetric` declaration.

  **Deduped by handle *and bindings*, not by handle.**  A palindrome — `(sibOf Ann Ann)`,
  or any pattern the mirror binds exactly as the direct probe did — is one answer.  A
  pattern whose arguments are both variables matches one stored fact **twice,
  differently**: `(sibOf ?a ?b)` over a stored `(sibOf Rex Tib)` binds `?a Rex, ?b Tib`
  directly and `?a Tib, ?b Rex` through the mirror, and those are two answers about one
  handle.  A dedup keyed on the handle alone drops the second, so a join led by such a
  literal sees one orientation, and which literal leads is a plan decision.

  Lazy through the fan: each probe filters against what the earlier probes emitted, and
  the set handed to the next is not built until a consumer walks past its own hits, so a
  consumer answered by the direct hits pays for no second probe and no set.

  Three things it decides, once:

  * **A negation fans its body's functor upward** (`super-predicates`), the direction a

  **A negation fans its body's functor the other way**, over `super-predicates`:

(defn- lead-candidates
  "A **lazy** superset of the matching handles, led by the tightest bound argument.
  The argument roots are scoped by predicate and end in the context, so with a spec
  closure in hand the read is each sub-predicate's own node at that position, restricted
  to the contexts in `up` (the reader's ancestor set, nil for a variable context) — the
  predicate filter is satisfied by construction, and no leaf stored where the reader
  cannot see is read.  Where `*lead-side*` reads the slot roster, the roster's predicates
  are kept to `specs` before a node is read, so every source holds only the literal's
  sub-predicates.  A variable functor reads the predicate-agnostic union instead (over
  the slot roster), which spans every functor; with no bound argument at all, the
  sub-predicates' predicate extents.  A ground prefix walks the trie under it unless
  `arg-lead` reads its argument roots.  Every source reads only the contexts in `up`.  A
  symmetric sub-predicate may store the term at the mirror position, and a commutative
  one at any position of the term's commuting component, so when any sub-predicate
  permutes that position every position it reaches is taken.

  Lazy so an existence check short-circuits without realizing the whole candidate set:
  each posting set is handed back by reference and the per-spec fan is `lazy-mapcat`,
  so buckets are read one sub-predicate at a time as `matches-hierarchical` consumes
  them.  The permuted multi-position concat can repeat a handle stored at more than one
  of them; `matches-hierarchical`'s `seen` set dedups the emitted matches, so the
  result stays the identical set."

  per symbol on `merged?` (one `contains?` against a snapshot held by the caller) so an
  unmerged sentence never reaches the election.  `visible` is the caller's **delay** over
  the supporter memo, forced only by a symbol that got that far.  Public for the reads
  whose match shape `without-retired` cannot take — `qcn-kb/refuted-pairs` yields
  `[handle a b]` triples with no sentex at index 2, so it filters with this directly.

  **A sentence that quotes takes the mention-aware read instead.**  Inside a quoted
  position — a `quoting_function`'s arguments, or the proposition an attitude attributes to
  its agent — a symbol is retired by a *spelling* rename and not by a `sameAs` / `equals`
  identity merge, which makes the flat per-symbol shortcut unsound there and would retire a
  belief nobody renamed.  Whether the sentence quotes at all is asked first
  (`any-mention-position?`), so an ordinary sentence in a KB that merely grants `believes`
  keeps the flat read.

  **An equality relation's arguments are mentions too** (`equality-mention-heads`): a
  `sameAs` merge does not restate `(not (sameAs A B))`, so the flat read, which would
  call `B` retired, is confirmed against the structural walk before it drops the
  sentence.  A positive **equation** is never retired at all (`equation?`): migration
  never restates one, so dropping it would leave a believed equation that no read

  `jtms/superseded` holds a spelling out of belief once its own context elects another,

  context.  Staleness is per *reader*.  A fact stated above a merge is believed where it
  lives — its own context was told nothing — while a context below the merge sees both it

  "Type-aware matches of `sentence` *visible from* `view-context`.  A variable
  context means any context; a concrete context sees a fact iff the fact's
  context is in view-context's genlCx up-closure — this is how inference in a
  specific context can use facts asserted in the general contexts it inherits.

  A positive literal is answered by the set-algebra path (`matches-hierarchical`,
  default) instead of the nested fan-out; bind `*hierarchical-retrieval*` false for the
  reference fan-out.

  A sentex an `except` has hidden from `view-context` is filtered out — the read side
  of visibility removal.  Forward chaining holds the same line by a different
  mechanism: its join runs at `'?ctx`, where the hidden set is empty by construction,
  and the block is applied per *placement* (`chain/antecedent-hidden?`,
  `justification-excepted?`), where the context the except scopes to is known.

  Answers are **cached per KB** by the literal they answer, α-renamed so two spellings
  of one question share an entry, and stamped with the change clock so any mutation
  retires them (`vaelii.impl.literal-cache`).  **All three** retrieval-strategy vars are
  part of the key rather than assumed away: the set-algebra and fan-out paths must agree
  on the answer set, and so must the structural-trie and functor-extent candidate
  sources, which is what `retrieval_completeness_test` and `structural_index_test` check
  — a cache that served one path's answers to the other would be checking a result
  against itself.  With `literal-cache/*enabled*` false this is the bare call.

  `*belief-blind*` is in the key for the same reason and a sharper one: a `CxEverything`
  read and an ordinary one ask the *same literal at the same context* and must not answer
  each other.  Left off, the first read of a pair fills the entry and the second is served
  it — so a blind read would hide a defeated default it was asked for, or an ordinary one
  would report a default it must not, whichever happened to run first.

  `tax/*search*` is in the key because a read inside a second-route search reads belief
  alone for a belief read, and can read false off a route question still open above it.
  `tax/*network-belief*` is in the key because a placement in `chain` reads the network
  and the excepts, and no defeat (`exc/hidden-fn`).

  **`cached?` false asks the same question and neither consults the cache nor fills
  it** — for a caller whose repeats that cache cannot serve.  A transitive closure walk
  asks each node's neighbour literal once (`provers/reach` visits a node once), so there
  is no repeat there for a solution cache to catch, while its insertion per node would
  push the cache past its bound and clear it wholesale part-way through, evicting the
  metadata literals a rule-heavy query really does re-ask.  An argument rather than a
  rebinding of `literal-cache/*enabled*`, for two reasons: a `binding` covers every read
  *under* the walk rather than the neighbour probe alone, and it marks the var
  thread-bound for the life of the process — so every later `matches-visible` on every
  thread would take the thread-local path to read a flag nothing had rebound.  The
  repetition a walk does have is held where it is: `provers/cached-reach` for the whole
  closure, `observe/*reach-memo*` for the neighbour sets a join re-walks."

(defn constraining-predicates
  "The predicates whose argument declarations of kind `kind` bind a `pred` tuple —
  `pred` itself first, then every super-predicate of it `context` can see that some
  sentence declares `kind` of.

  `(genl fatherOf parentOf)` says every `fatherOf` tuple **is** a `parentOf` tuple, and
  a tuple set only narrows going down, so `(arg parentOf 1 person)` constrains every
  `fatherOf` tuple exactly as it constrains every `parentOf` one.  Reading the
  declarations off the exact functor makes the refusal *entry-point-dependent*: the same
  ill-typed claim is refused under the general spelling, admitted under the specialized
  one, and then answers every general-spelling query through the matcher's own fan —
  which is the one job the constraint exists for.  Both readers of a declaration come
  here, the constraint (`checks/declaration-reader`) and the inference
  (`provers/inferred-types`), so `assert` and `ask` cannot disagree about whose
  declarations speak for a tuple.

  **Scoped to the reader's own vantage.**  The closure is read from `context`, so a
  `genl` edge asserted where the reader cannot see it imports no constraint — the same
  judgement `checks/args-problem` already makes about the memberships it reads.  A cycle
  in predicate `genl` cannot loop the walk, `genls` being a closure read.

  **`pred` and its proper supers are both filtered against the roster** of predicates
  some declaration of `kind` names (`tax/arg-declaration-props`).  A predicate the
  roster does not name carries no `(kind predicate …)` declaration in any context, so
  the scoped retrieval its inclusion would gate returns nothing; every consumer reads
  declarations off the predicates handed back, so an undeclared predicate contributes an
  empty retrieval whether it is listed or dropped.  The filter is a set membership rather
  than an index probe, which is what keeps the walk cheap: asked of the index it would be
  one argument-root read per predicate per assert, so a membership of a type ten deep in
  the hierarchy would pay ten of them, and nine of those types declare nothing —
  including, on a minting assert, the mint's own functor (a type name like `animal`,
  which no sentence declares `arg` of).  The roster is global and therefore a superset of
  what any context can see, and the scoped retrieval it gates decides which of the named
  predicates actually speak here.  When nothing anywhere declares `kind` the roster is
  empty and the walk returns `[]` without reading the closure at all.  The intersection
  walks the smaller of the roster and the closure, so a membership of a type with
  thousands of ancestors reads at most the roster.

  The supers are sorted, so which declaration a refusal names — and the order the
  entailments are drawn in — is a function of the vocabulary rather than of the closure's
  hash order."

  The per-path `seen` set cuts a goal re-asking *itself*; a rule whose antecedent

  measures against rises whenever a leaf match binds a deep *stored* term

  that *shrinks* a term — walking a list, counting a numeral down — untouched at any

  it measured from that individual's depth rather than from the query's.  Termination is

;; these through the registry (`chain/solve-deferred`); the two backward chainers here
;; must do the same, or a rule with such an antecedent silently proves nothing.  But this
;; namespace sits *below* the registry (`provers` requires `resolution`), so it cannot name
;; `provers/solve-goal` at compile time — `unknown` runs the registry back over its own
;; argument, which makes negation-as-failure mutually recursive with the chainer asking for
;; it.  So the registry is reached through `vaelii.impl.wiring`, where that call is one of
;; the two the require graph cannot express and the reason is written down.

;; again, which would answer both sides of a clash belief has settled.
;;
;; The contract is that they do not: **the proving levels agree with belief.**  Belief has
;; decided that datum is OUT under the current state, and a chainer that reads it IN is not
;; answering a harder question, it is answering a stale one.  That holds for a defeated
;; *premise* a rule re-derives from other believed premises too, and deliberately: the
;; defeat is a claim about the datum, not about one derivation of it, so a second route to
;; the same sentence reaches the same OUT.  Retract the defeater and the datum revives, and
;; the chainers answer it again with nothing else having changed.
;;
;; **Only `defeated`.**  The other two non-belief states are handled elsewhere and must not
;; be folded in here: a `blocked` justification is swept, so nothing survives for a chainer
;; to find, and a `superseded` spelling is displaced by an equality merge, which the goal
;; rewrite applies before any prover sees the goal (docs/equality.md).
;;
;; **The stored-fact leaf is not on this path.**  `matches-visible` filters belief already,
;; so a defeated stored fact never matches; what this adds is a check on the answers *rule
;; expansion* produces, one lookup apiece and only for a goal whose functor some defeated

  defeated — or **nil** when the walk reads nothing (`exc/placed-reads?`).

  (`term-depth`), the basis the term-growth cut starts measuring a subgoal against.  It
  is a *starting* basis rather than a fixed one: a leaf match that binds a deeper stored
  term raises it for the frames below (`grown-term-base`), so what the ceiling bounds is
  the nesting a rule invented rather than the nesting the KB already held.

  The basis rides the *stack* rather than the bounds map because the stack is the

  from a budget could not know what the original question asked for.  The term base
  rides it for the same reason, and for a second: it is per **path**, so a resumed

(defn prove
  "A simple depth-first backward chainer using loop/recur over an explicit goal
  stack.  Returns a vector of fully-resolved solution binding maps for proving the
  conjunction `goals` in `context`.  Type-aware (specificity) and context-aware
  (matches-visible); a per-path :seen set of goal-keys blocks a goal from
  re-expanding itself through recursive rules, and a term-growth ceiling
  (`default-max-term-growth`) blocks a subgoal whose arguments nest deeper than
  anything its own path has met, by more than the allowance — the recursion a goal key
  cannot see, since a rule wrapping a function around a head variable asks a fresh goal
  per expansion.
  Together the two make every search terminate on the data.  Prefer right-recursive
  rules — a left-recursive rule is pruned after its first expansion.  `rules-fn`
  maps a subgoal to candidate parsed rules.

  Runs to completion; `prove-from` is the bounded/resumable variant this delegates
  to (`vaelii.core/prove-within` builds the anytime contract on it), and `prove-seq`
  is the same search driven lazily.

  The 5-arg arity takes `prove-from`'s `bounds` map (`prove-seq`'s keys, plus
  `:max-results`), so a caller can run this eager search with a **registry leaf**
  (`{:leaf-solver provers/solve-goal :est-override (provers/registry-est-override kb ctx)}`)
  — an antecedent answered by a prover, an evaluatable or a cached closure rather than only
  a stored fact, the division `vaelii.core/prove` and `vaelii.core/query` run.  The 4-arg
  keeps the stored-fact leaf (`nil` bounds)."

(defn prove-seq
  "The same search as `prove`, **lazily** — a seq of solution binding maps that costs one
  solution per pull rather than the whole space up front.

  `prove-from` is already resumable, so this needs no second engine: run it capped at one
  result, hand back that solution, and resume from the `:stack` it left when the consumer
  asks again.  `:capped` is the only status that means *more, and allowed to continue* —
  `:complete` is exhaustion and `:timeout` is a deadline the caller set, and both end the
  seq.

  `bounds` takes `prove-from`'s keys except `:max-results`, which this drives itself; a
  consumer bounds the result count by taking that many.

  Laziness costs the search **one scope per segment** rather than one per run (see the
  comment in `prove-from`): the transitive-closure memo starts empty on each pull, and
  resident values are re-read rather than pinned across the whole seq.  For a read that is
  sound — a query mutates no belief, so there is no write for a pin to hold still against.

  It is also, measurably, not paid for: over a 120-answer recursive chain, realizing
  *every* answer through this costs what the eager loop costs (40.3 ms against 40.4 ms),
  while taking one costs about half (19.0 ms against 35.0 ms) — and that chain is the
  unfavourable shape, one whose search dives to its deepest answer before yielding a
  first.  Where answers come early the gap is a multiple, not a fraction.  So `prove`
  remains the call for wanting a vector back, not for wanting it cheaper."
