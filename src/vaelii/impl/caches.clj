  "What this process is holding beside the stores — one register every derived,
  droppable structure declares itself in, and one read over the lot.

  The stores are measured elsewhere: `catalog/heap` reports the JVM's own figure and
  `catalog/footprint` estimates what a loaded KB costs.  Neither says anything about the
  **caches** — the atoms and plain maps holding answers the engine would otherwise
  recompute — and a hit rate is the only evidence a cost model has.  \"The
  second query was fast\" is a demo; \"the second query was fast because it was served
  from a cache, and here is the rate\" is a measurement.

  **A register rather than a dozen accessors.**  This namespace requires only `config` and
  the logger, neither of which holds a cache, so the reader still has no require edge down
  to a namespace holding one: every such namespace requires *this* one and declares itself at load, and
  there is no list here that a new cache has to be added to twice.  The `config` edge reads
  one switch, `VAELII_CACHE_SCALE`, and `limit-of` applies it to every count-bounded
  cache's limit.  A cache in a namespace this
  process never loaded — a qualitative calculus nobody registered, the metric-time
  reasoner — is absent from the read because it is absent from the process, rather than
  present as a row of zeroes.

  **Two scopes, and never one wearing the other's clothes.**  `:scope` says what a row's
  `:entries` counts: `:kb` for a cache hanging off a KB record, `:process` for a static
  one every KB in the JVM shares.  `:counters` says the same about `:hits` / `:misses`,
  separately: the closure neighbours keep process counters over entries only a live
  search step can count, and a row counted by a derived-state tally counts per structure.

  **`:unit` is not decoration.**  One cache counts literals, another counts networks, a
  third counts symbols, and a column of bare integers compares none of them.

  A row whose `:entries` is nil is one that cannot be counted from outside — the
  scope-bound caches, bound for the length of one chaining run or one search step and
  garbage when it returns.  They are registered all the same, with the reason in
  `:note`, so the list is complete rather than merely finite.

  **A row answers for itself, and fails for itself.**  The register is open, so a read
  here runs code this namespace has never seen; one that throws is reported as a row
  carrying `:error` rather than allowed to take the answer down with it.  A diagnostic
  is worth most while something is already wrong, which is exactly when it must not be
  the next thing to break."

    :trim      (fn [kb target]) -> entries dropped, or absent.  The **partial** drop the

  `:read`, `:clear` and `:reset-counters` all take the KB even when the cache is
  process-wide, so a caller needs no second calling convention for the static ones; they
  ignore it.

  **`:limit` takes a thunk for the same reason `:read` is a function.**  A descriptor is
  built once, at namespace load, so a constant captured into it is that constant forever
  — which is right for a `def` and wrong for a `^:dynamic` var, since being rebindable is
  the only reason such a var is dynamic.  Reporting the root bound while the engine
  enforces a bound somebody rebound would misreport the one field a reader uses to judge

  "Drop every cache that offers a clear, and say what went: `{:cleared [{:cache :label

  Not `!`, and the reason is the whole point of the control: every entry is derived, the
  next read recomputes it, and no belief moves.  That makes a clear a measuring
  instrument rather than an edit — clear, ask the same question again, and watch the
  miss the second ask no longer gets to skip.

  **Scoped to `kb`, because the argument says so.**  Every `:clear` drops that cache's
  entries *for this KB* and nothing else.  The hit and miss counters some caches keep are
  process-wide — they measure the mechanism rather than a store — and zeroing one would
  reset a rate every other KB in the JVM is reporting, mid-measurement.  So it is not
  done here: `{:counters? true}` asks for it, in a call that says out loud it is reaching
  past its argument, and the answer then carries `:counters-reset` naming the caches it
  touched.  A function whose signature names one KB must not quietly be a per-process
  control; `caches`' `:counters` column is how a caller knows which rows the option is
  about.  The same option zeroes `kb`'s derived-state tallies (`row-tally`), and the
  answer carries `:tallies-reset`, `[{:row id …what it held}]`.

  A cache with no `:clear` is left alone and is not in the answer.  Those are the
  structural ones — the symbol pool, the compiled relation algebras — where dropping the
  entries costs the sharing they exist for and buys no measurement.

  A clear that throws costs its own entry and no other, the way a read does: its row
  carries `:error` and an entry count of zero."
