  "Cached transitive closures for the two transitivity relations at the heart of
  common-sense reasoning:

    genl    relates predicates       (genl dog animal)   — types are its unary case
    genlCx  relates *contexts*       (genlCx CxA CxB)     — context inheritance

  Transitivity is not done with rules (too central, too hot); instead we store the
  **direct adjacency** of each relation and answer the reflexive-transitive up/down
  closure *on demand*.  `genls` is ancestors-incl-self, `specs` is descendants-
  incl-self.

  We deliberately do **not** materialize the full closure.  A materialized closure
  is Θ(V²) for a deep hierarchy — a 10k-node `genl` chain stores ~50M pairs — so
  building it incrementally makes a bulk load quadratic no matter how clever each
  insert is: the representation itself is the cost.  Storing only the O(V+E)
  adjacency makes a closure read O(reachable-subgraph) and an insert the adjacency
  write plus a depth repair — O(1) for an edge arriving parent-before-child, and
  proportional to the *descendants* of the node `raise-depth` lifts for one arriving
  child-first, so that order is quadratic in the hierarchy and `*defer-depths?*` is
  the trade written for it.  Reads are memoized per closure
  *generation* (bumped on every edge change), so a shallow hierarchy — where the
  reachable subgraph is tiny — still answers each repeat read in O(1).

  - **Insertion** records the edge in `:fwd` / `:rev` and, so cycle checks stay
    cheap, maintains a topological `:depth` potential (`edge x→y ⇒ depth[x] >
    depth[y]`).  No closure is touched.
  - **Deletion** drops the edge from the adjacency and prunes any node left with no
    edge.  Depths are left as loose upper bounds — a deletion only relaxes the
    ordering, so the invariant survives untouched.
  - **Cycle safety.** `genl?` / `sees?` answer reachability with an early-exit walk
    pruned by `:depth`: a real path `x → … → y` has strictly decreasing depth, so
    `depth[x] ≤ depth[y]` rejects the pair in O(1).  `wff` rejects `genl` /
    `genlCx` cycles up front, so the closures stay acyclic; `reach` guards with a `seen` set
    regardless, so a stray cycle terminates rather than being subtly wrong.

  `closures` (the from-scratch materialized build) survives as the **reference
  implementation** the on-demand reads are tested against — the oracle test in
  `taxonomy_test` compares `genls` / `specs` for every node against it after every
  random edit.

  Context semantics: (genlCx Sub Super) means Sub *sees* Super's assertions, so a
  context K sees a sentex in context Y iff Y is in genls-of-contexts(K).

  ## Edges are supported, and support is belief-sensitive

  Every sentex that asserts an edge is a **supporter**, stored in the index's supporter
  families under the key `[:genl a b]` (`kv/post-supporter!`) with its context; a nil
  context means the writer had none to record (a probe) and the edge constrains
  everywhere.  A relation is `{:edges #{[a b]} :edge-ctxs {} :fwd {} :rev {} :nodes #{}
  :depth {} :gen n}`, and `:edges` is the *active* set the closures are computed from — an
  edge with no believed supporter is not in it.  That distinction is what keeps three
  things right:

  - **Belief.** A defeated `(genl dog animal)` leaves the closure, so `isa?` cannot
    outrun belief.  Matching is belief-sensitive everywhere in the engine, the
    taxonomy included; `refresh-beliefs` reconciles after a relabel.
  - **Reference counting.** The same edge asserted in two contexts is two sentexes.
    Retracting one must not remove the edge while the other still asserts it.
  - **Idempotence.** Re-asserting an edge that is already active is a no-op —
    `activate` returns early rather than touching the adjacency at all.

  ## Equality is the third supported relation, and it is not a partial order

  `rewriteOf` / `sameAs` / `equals` all feed one **equivalence** closure, so it is
  stored as a partition — member → class, class → members and representative —
  rather than as up/down closures.  It shares the supporter discipline above, keeping its
  own `:support` map, and nothing else: insertion is a union, and deletion can *split* a
  class, which no union-find can undo, so it rebuilds the affected class from its
  surviving edges.
  See the section below and docs/equality.md.

  The same belief discipline reaches the six flat caches too — `disjoint`, the
  disjoint metatypes and their members, the sibling-disjoint marks, the predicate
  properties, `inverse`, and the declared arities.
  Their supporters are stored in the same families under each entry's `[kind key]`, and
  `refresh-beliefs` reconciles each cache entry against belief exactly as
  `refresh-relation` does for genl — an entry is active iff some supporter is stored
  *and* believed.  So a
  defeated `(disjoint dog cat)` stops constraining, a defeated `(functional P)` stops
  merging, and a defeated `(inverse P Q)` stops answering the swapped goal, the way a
  defeated genl edge leaves the closure.  See docs/taxonomy.md."

(defn- reachable?
  "Is `tgt` in the reflexive-transitive reach of `src` over adjacency map `adj`,
  given topological potentials `depth` and the component map `scc`?

  `depth` is a potential over the **condensation** — the DAG of strongly connected
  components — so it obeys `edge x→y ⇒ depth[x] ≥ depth[y]`, strictly when `x` and
  `y` lie in different components and by equality inside one.  `scc` maps a node to
  its component's representative, and holds an entry **only for a node in a
  non-trivial component**; an acyclic relation (which `genl` always is, and
  `genlCx` usually is) has an empty one and pays a nil check.

  Three O(1) consequences make this cheap in the overwhelmingly common case:

  - same component ⇒ mutually reachable, by definition.  No walk at all.
  - otherwise a real path `src → … → tgt` must leave `src`'s component, so it
    strictly descends at least once: `depth[src] ≤ depth[tgt]` ⇒ unreachable.  For a
    hierarchy built roughly parent-before-child — the load order of a taxonomy — the
    node being checked against is always shallower, so the pair is rejected outright.
  - during the walk, a neighbour *below* `tgt`'s depth cannot lie on a path to it, and
    neither can one *level* with it in a different component (that path would have to
    descend too), so both are pruned — and a neighbour level with it in `tgt`'s own
    component answers true outright.

  Depths are only ever grown, never shrunk (deletion leaves them loose), so the
  invariant — hence soundness — holds regardless of edit history.  A missing depth is
  treated as `-1` (below everything): a non-node `tgt` is unreachable, a non-node
  `src` reaches only itself.

  **`depth` may be nil**, meaning no usable potential: a deferred batch insert whose
  `local-lift` broke an edge above it, or an edge that closed a cycle, leaves the
  relation `:loose?` until `restore-depths` runs.  The pruning is then dropped and the
  walk is plain — the same answer, paid for by visiting `src`'s whole reach instead of
  a prefix of it.  Pruning with a potential that is no longer sound would answer
  *false* for a real path, which here means `genl?` silently losing a subtype and
  `sees?` silently losing a context.

  Walking unpruned is **much** more expensive than it looks — on a deep hierarchy it
  is the difference between an O(1) rejection and a full ancestor walk, and `wff` pays
  one per taxonomy edge asserted — so going loose is a last resort, not the deferred
  path's normal state (see `local-lift`)."

;; what lets `refresh-beliefs` read the edges a settle could have moved **off the moved
;; region** rather than off the relation (`moved-keys`): belief moves by handle, and only
;; an edge some moved handle supports can have changed its believed-supporter set.
;;
;; `:dirty` is the other half of that scope, and it exists because the edge writers are
;; **belief-blind**: `add-edge` and `del-edge` run on the assert/retract path, where no
;; `believed?` is in hand, so they recompute `:edge-ctxs` from every stored supporter
;; rather than from the believed ones.  On an edge with a single supporter that is exact.
;; On a shared edge it is a superset — a disbelieved supporter's context reads as
;; asserting — and only a reconcile can narrow it.  So a writer leaving a shared edge
;; behind names it here, and the next reconcile takes it whether or not belief moved
;; there.  A superset is the safe interim reading (a scoped read sees an edge it should
;; not, never misses one it should), and the set stays proportional to the edits: the
;; single-supporter edge that is nearly every edge, and all of a bulk load, never enters
;; it.
;; Beside the edge set, `:edge-ctxs {[a b] #{ctx}}` is **derived context state**, a
;; function of the supporters and belief the way `:edges` is: the supporting contexts of each
;; *active* edge (keys ≡ `:edges`); nil in the set marks a supporter with no recorded
;; context, which constrains everywhere.  `:gen` bumps whenever an entry moves, not only
;; when an edge appears or disappears — a scoped closure read is a function of these, so
;; they retire the read memo exactly as the edge set does.  The contexts that state a
;; supporter at all are read from the index (`census-in`).
;;
;; `:depth` is a potential over the **condensation**, and `:scc` is what makes it one:
;; a node in a strongly connected component maps to that component's representative

  "The up-closure of `node`, built as `C ∪ ⋃ closure(p)` over the parents `p` outside its

  builds is handed to `hold!` under its component's representative — one entry for a
  component of thousands, which every member reads — so the ancestors many types share
  are built once, and a type's closure shares structure with its largest
  parent's rather than copying it.  `reach` instead climbs the whole ancestry again for
  every type, which is the clash pass's cost on a deep taxonomy.

  Components come from `scc` (node → representative, non-trivial components only), so the
  walk is over the condensation, which is acyclic.  `scc` never names a false component —
  an edge removal repairs it eagerly — but a deferred cycle-closing edge can leave a real
  one out.  Such a cycle brings a unit back to the top of the stack still waiting on a
  parent, and the build answers nil, as it does when a parent's closure `held` answered
  was evicted before it was read; the caller walks instead.

  With a transducer `xf` other than nil, each answer is the union of what `xf` makes of
  the closure's terms, by the same recurrence: what `xf` makes of a union is the union of
  what it makes of the parts (`genls-global-union`).

  `walk`, when given, answers a unit with two or more parents not yet built, in place of
  building them: a whole closure built from two parents costs the smaller parent's
  closure, so building every ancestor of one cold type costs the sum of their closures,
  quadratic on a braid, where one walk costs the type's own."

;; folding into one entry, and retracting either must leave the entry while the other is
;; stored and believed.  So an entry is counted by its supporters, which are the index's
;; supporter family under its key (`kv/post-supporter!`), exactly as a `genl` edge's are:
;; an entry is active iff some supporter is stored *and* believed, and
;; `refresh-cache-support` reconciles it after every relabel the way `refresh-relation`
;; does the closures.  `cache-install` / `cache-uninstall` are the one definition of an
;; active entry, shared by the assert-time `add-*` / `mark-*` functions and that reconcile.

;; ones by `refresh-cache-support`.  No generation rides on it — the flat caches are point
;; lookups, never memoized closures.

  **A set per term, not one partner.**  Nothing refuses a second `(inverse P R)` beside

  (`local-lift`), going `:loose?` if that breaks an edge above it; `restore-depths`
  rebuilds every depth in one pass when the batch settles.

  `raise-depth` is proportional to the *descendants* of the node it lifts, which is
  the one thing an insert is not supposed to be: adding a hundred thousand edges in an
  order that repeatedly lifts high nodes re-walks their subtrees over and over, so a
  bulk load arriving child-first is quadratic in the hierarchy.  Deferring makes the
  insert O(1) plus the source's in-degree, and pays one O(V+E) repair per batch.

  Going loose is **not** free, which is why `local-lift` exists rather than a blanket
  `:loose?`: while loose `reachable?` drops its pruning, and `wff` runs one such walk
  per taxonomy edge asserted.  Trading the eager repair for a blanket loose potential
  would only swap which arrival order is quadratic — child-first would get cheap and
  parent-first, the *natural* order for a hierarchy, would get expensive.  The local
  lift keeps the potential sound for exactly the orders `raise-depth` was already cheap
  on, so neither order pays.

  `activate` repairs a cycle-closing edge eagerly by default, even under
  `*defer-depths?*`: a forward firing seeded by that edge reads `:scc` through
  `placement-rep` before the batch settles, so a deferred `:scc` would place one
  conclusion on two members of a `genlCx` cycle (see `activate`).  Recovery has no such
  reader.  `rebuild-taxonomy` and the belief reconcile that follows it read `:scc` only
  through `reachable?`, which walks unpruned while `:loose?` and so answers correctly
  from a stale `:scc`; the first `placement-rep` read is `settle`, which runs after
  `restore-depths`.  So recovery binds this true and pays one O(V+E) repair for the
  whole replay, not one per cycle-closing edge.  A corpus decides how many those are,
  and a foreign or bulk writer, or a store replayed past the assert-time cycle checks
  (`wff/genl-problems`, `wff/genlCx-problems`), can leave a large strong component whose
  every internal edge would otherwise repair the whole relation again.

  A caller that binds this must call `restore-depths` before any `placement-rep` reader

  `:rev a` — an in-degree scan, not a descendant walk.  If none is broken the global

  Edges arriving **parent-before-child** — a hierarchy's natural load order, and the

(defn- activate
  "Bring [a b] into the active edge set: record the direct adjacency, the node set,
  and repair the depth potential.  A no-op when the edge is already active, so a
  redundant re-assert adds no work and leaves the read memo valid.

  `wff` (assert path) and `special/wff-violation` (derivation path) both refuse a
  `genl` or `genlCx` edge that would close a cycle before it reaches here, so a fresh
  assert never takes the cyclic branch.  An edge reaches it only past those checks: a
  store replayed by `recovery/recover`, a foreign or bulk writer, or a belief-race
  revival (defeat an edge, assert its reverse, revive the first — the checks read the
  active adjacency).  The `reachable?` guard is O(1) in the common case (`a` is a
  fresh or shallower node, rejected outright).

  An edge that **closes a cycle** merges two components, which is a question about the
  whole graph rather than about this edge: `raise-depth`'s termination assumes
  acyclicity, so the relation is repaired outright with `repair-depths` — one O(V+E)
  pass, for an event a corpus has a few dozen of — and leaves here with `:scc` already
  holding the merged component.  Repairing now rather than at the batch's settle is
  what `placement-rep` needs: the cycle-closing edge chains *before* the batch settles,
  and a firing seeded by it reads `:scc` to land its conclusion on the component's one
  representative.  Left to `restore-depths`, that firing would
  read the pre-merge map and land on whichever member it happened to see, and the same
  firing re-derived later would land on the representative — two sentexes for one
  claim in contexts that see each other.

  Under `*defer-depths?*` the acyclic repair is `local-lift` instead — the edge's own
  source, not its descendants.

  Under `*defer-cycle-scc?*` — recovery's replay, where no `placement-rep` reader runs
  before `restore-depths` — the cyclic repair is deferred as well: the first cycle marks
  the relation `:loose?`, `restore-depths` computes `:scc` once for the whole batch, and
  every edge after that first cycle skips the detection walk (the branch is `loose?`
  either way).  So the whole replay is O(V+E), not this branch recomputing `:scc` — nor
  the loose detection walking `b`'s reach — per cycle-closing edge (see the var).

  An **already-loose** relation short-circuits the *acyclic* repair, whether or not this
  insert is deferred: with no sound potential `raise-depth` would build on a stale base,
  so the adjacency is recorded and `restore-depths` is left to own it.  Reading
  `:loose?` rather than the dynamic var alone is what keeps that true for an insert
  arriving *after* a batch aborted — the settle that would have repaired never ran.
  What refuses a `genl` or `genlCx` cycle throughout is `wff`, which reads through
  `reachable-in?` and stays correct while loose.

  A **cycle is still detected while loose**, and paid for, because `:scc` is not a
  pruning: the deferral may postpone a depth, but a firing seeded by the closing edge
  reads `:scc` through `placement-rep` the moment it is placed, and the whole reason
  the cyclic branch repairs outright is that leaving it to the batch's settle puts one
  claim in two mutually-visible contexts.  The guard then walks unpruned — `b`'s whole
  up-closure rather than a prefix of it — which is why it is gated on `a` already being
  a node: nothing can reach the sub an edge is introducing, so an edge arriving
  parent-before-child costs one `contains?`, and that is the order a loose batch is
  still mostly made of.  The repair that follows also lifts `:loose?`, so the batch pays
  it once at the cycle rather than once per edge after it."

  "Repair the component a removed edge sat inside, and the depths its split invalidates.
  A stale `:scc` entry is the one thing in this relation that would answer *true* for a
  pair no longer connected, so it is never left standing.

  **Only an edge whose two endpoints share a component can change one.** A component's
  strong connectivity is a property of its own induced subgraph, and an edge with an
  endpoint outside — or with none in a component at all — is not in that subgraph. So
  every other deletion, which is every deletion in an acyclic relation and most of them
  in a cyclic one, is left alone here: nothing to recompute, and the potential stays
  sound, since removing an edge only relaxes the ordering it has to satisfy.

  When they do share one, the component's own induced subgraph is re-run through
  `strong-components` — the new components of the whole graph refine the old ones, so
  what a split produces is contained in the component that split, and the answer is
  proportional to it rather than to the relation. A component that survives the deletion
  intact leaves everything as it was. A split takes new depths from `split-depths`, and
  a sub-component whose new depth is higher than the one it is replacing pushes that
  rise up through `lift-components`.

  The relation therefore does **not** go `:loose?`, and reads keep their pruning
  through a deletion that would otherwise have cost a whole-relation `repair-depths`.
  The one case that does surrender is a relation **already** loose: there is no sound
  potential to repair against, so the component is dropped whole and the batch's own
  `restore-depths` rebuilds it.  Dropping is not optional there — a loose relation
  still reads `:scc` for the \"same component ⇒ mutually reachable\" answer, which is
  the one thing an unpruned walk cannot correct."

(defn- refresh-relation
  "Active edges are those with at least one *believed* supporter, carrying the
  believed supporters' contexts.  Applies the difference edge by edge rather than
  rebuilding, so a settle whose region names no edge returns the relation untouched.
  Where it names edges the pass is not free of belief: one classifying pass evaluates
  `believed-ctxs` over every named edge's supporters before any arm runs, so a settle
  that changed no belief still pays one belief test per supporter of every edge in its
  region and the three arms then find nothing to apply.

  The classifying pass keeps only the edges whose state changes, each under the arm it
  needs.  The memory the pass holds is therefore proportional to the edges that change,
  not to the region.  A recovery names every edge, and holds no per-edge context map of
  the whole taxonomy while the arms run.

  Scoped to `edges` (`moved-keys`) and `:dirty`, the edges a belief-blind writer left
  owing a reconcile — an edge no moved handle supports and no writer left dirty is
  provably unchanged, so belief is never evaluated for it.  That is the locality
  invariant for this cache: the reconcile costs what moved, not what is stored.  This is
  the pass that discharges `:dirty`, so it clears the set on the way in.  Each edge's
  supporters are read through the supporter cache, which holds them.

  Three arms, not two.  An edge can keep its liveness while its *contexts* move —
  supported from A by h1 and from B by h2, h2 defeated: the edge stays active and B
  must leave `:edge-ctxs`, or a scoped read from B would answer through a defeated
  supporter.  Liveness alone cannot see that case, so the still-active edges are
  retargeted explicitly (`set-edge-ctxs` bumps the gen only when a set actually
  moved, so the arm is free for the common belief-preserving settle).

  The arms run in that order — deactivate, activate, retarget — rather than edge by
  edge, and it is not presentation.  `activate` condenses the whole relation across an
  edge that would close a cycle, so an activation reading a graph that still holds the
  edges this same pass is about to drop can pay a repair, and record a component, that
  the settled graph never has.  Draining the deactivations first is what keeps the
  potential's fate a function of the settled edge set rather than of the order two arms
  happened to run in."

;; **equivalence**, and copying that shape would store every class as a complete
;; graph — quadratic, and it still would not answer "who represents this class?",
;; which is the only question the rewrite path actually asks.  So this is a
;; **partition**: member → class, class → members and representative.
;;
;; All three assertable relations feed it.  They differ in what they say *about* the
;; members, not in the classes they produce, and the whole of that difference rides
;; in one argument: `preferred` names the term a `rewriteOf` puts on top, and is nil
;; for `sameAs` / `equals`.  The edge itself is therefore undirected while the
;; preference belongs to the *supporter* that made the claim — which is what lets a
;; `(sameAs A B)` and a `(rewriteOf B A)` support one edge while only the second
;; deprecates anything, and lets belief withdraw the preference without withdrawing
;; the merge.
;;
;; Support is belief-following exactly as it is for genl.  `:out` is the disbelieved
;; supporter set; `refresh-beliefs` recomputes it wholesale from the current support
;; keys, so it cannot accumulate handles whose sentex has since gone.
;;
;; Insertion is a union, and it costs the **joined class** rather than a pointer:
;; `install-class` re-keys every member and `class-rep` scans each member's incident
;; edges for the preference claims on them, so merging a term into a class of n costs n
;; and n asserts growing one class to n cost Θ(n²) between them.  That is the price of
;; storing the representative rather than deriving it per read, and the bound is the
;; class rather than the relation.  **Deletion can split a class**, which union-find

  no-op for a KB with no schematic equations.

  **Content-ordered, not insertion-ordered.**  Normalization tries rules in this
  order at each redex, so two overlapping rules that could rewrite one term must be
  ordered by *content* and not by which equation was asserted first — otherwise the
  normal form (and thus the stored twin) would depend on arrival order, which
  order-independence (docs/nmtms.md) forbids.  The key is the LHS then the RHS,
  arbitrary but stable and handle-free, so the same rule *set* always yields the same
  normal form, confluent or not.

  **The key is structural**, compared by `nm/compare-form` rather than printed.  A
  printed key is where this ordering would leak: `rewrite-active` is a map keyed by
  handle, so a caller with an ambient `*print-length*` — a REPL's, typically — would
  elide two long left-hand sides to one prefix, collapse the key, and drop the choice
  between two overlapping rules back onto that map's iteration order, which is a fact
  about which equation was asserted first.

  **Sorted once per rule set, not once per call.**  `kb/rewrite-term` calls this and
  `kb/rewrite-goal` calls that, so an unmemoized sort would put a key-build-per-rule
  cost on every `query` carrying a context — a cost the empty case (no schematic
  equations, the KB the gate above is written for) does not have but every KB with one
  would pay on every read.
  The order is memoized in the `:rewrite-order` side atom, beside the main map for the
  reasons `:closure-memo` is (a read that memoizes must not contend with the writer, or
  mutate the snapshot a concurrent reader holds).

  Stamped on the **identity** of the `:rewrite-active` map, not on a generation counter.
  A persistent map is its own change detector: every writer here already replaces it
  (`add-rewrite-rule`, `del-rewrite-rule!`, `refresh-rewrite`, `clear-relations!`) and
  none can replace it without producing a different object, so no writer has to remember
  to bump anything — the failure mode a counter has, and the one that matters most for a
  field three separate paths write.  It is also ABA-free where a counter is not:
  `clear-relations!` installs a fresh empty map, which is a *new* object, whereas a
  counter reset to 0 would make a cleared taxonomy read as the pre-clear one (exactly why
  `clear-relations!` has to drop the gen-stamped memo by hand).  The cost is a re-sort
  when `refresh-rewrite` rebuilds an equal set, which is a handful of rules."

  `:cache-dirty` is active iff some stored supporter is believed; install or uninstall its
  cache entry to match, reusing the very `cache-install` / `cache-uninstall` the assert
  path uses so the two can never disagree on what an active entry is.

  Every op here is O(1) and idempotent, so a reconciled entry is re-affirmed rather than
  diffed: there is no closure to rebuild, and `cache-install` on an entry already present
  changes nothing.  (genl's `refresh-relation` diffs only because rebuilding a *closure*
  is expensive.)

  An entry no moved handle supports and no writer left dirty is provably unchanged, so
  belief is never evaluated for it: the reconcile costs what moved, not what the KB

  is active iff some sentex asserting it is believed.  Called after a relabel (from
  `settle`), which is the only thing that can flip a supporter's label without adding
  or removing one.

  Cheap in the common case — `believed?` is an in-memory JTMS lookup, the closures are
  only rebuilt if the active edge set actually moved, an equality edge whose supporters
  did not change label is skipped outright, and the flat caches are single-op
  idempotent reconciles.  So a settle that defeats nothing applies no difference; what it
  still pays is its **region**.  Only the equality partition and the rewrite rules decline
  to look at all (the gate below), while the two transitive relations and the flat caches
  evaluate `believed-ctxs` for every edge and entry the region names before finding that
  none of them moved.  Zero work is a region naming nothing, not a belief that held still.

  Every cache follows belief here — the two transitive relations, the equality
  partition, and the seven flat caches (`disjoint`, disjoint metatypes + members, the
  sibling-disjoint marks, the `siblingDisjointException` pairs, the predicate properties,
  `inverse`, the declared arities) — so a defeated declaration stops taking effect the
  moment `settle` relabels, and a revived one takes effect again.

  `moved` is the set of handles whose belief just flipped (`jtms/touched`, a superset),
  and the caches read it two ways.  The two transitive relations and the flat caches
  **scope** by it — `moved-keys` turns the moved handles into the keys they install,
  read from the supporter families, and a settle reconciles those and nothing else, which
  is what keeps a flip in a 100k-edge taxonomy the price of a flip.

  The equality partition and the rewrite rules **gate** on it instead: a cache no moved
  handle supports is left alone, and a hit rescans it.  Both hold the KB's asserted
  term-identity claims rather than its vocabulary, and the gate reads whichever of the two
  sides is smaller, so a settle that moves neither pays the size of its own region.

  `nil` reconciles every key with a stored supporter, for a caller holding no region.
  `recover` is that caller and passes it: a settle's reconcile is scoped *and* gated on
  belief having moved, so a declaration nothing supports — OUT from the moment its node is
  made, opposed by nothing — has no settle event to lean on (`core/recover`).  Every
  `settle` path names a region instead; the supersession pass widens its own by hand
  rather than dropping it, because a supersession flip is a belief change with no relabel
  to record it."

;; ---- what a reachability rests on ---------------------------------------
;;
;; `genls` / `genl?` answer *whether* one type reaches another; a caller that is
;; going to **depend** on that reachability needs to name the sentexes it rests on,
;; so the dependency can be withdrawn when they are.  A forward firing matched by
;; subsumption is exactly such a caller (docs/contexts.md).
;;
;; The witness is **one path, one supporter per edge** — a justification is a
;; conjunction of supports, not a proof that no other support exists.  A second route
;; (another path, or the same edge asserted from a second context) therefore does not
;; appear; when the named witness goes, what rested on it goes with it and is
;; re-derived from the surviving route.  That is the bargain the qualitative support
;; already makes for the same reason (docs/qcn.md): every route re-derives what the
;; first one reached, so carrying them all would be one justification per path in a
;; hierarchy where paths multiply.
;;
;; The choice is keyed on **content** — the walk expands neighbours in name order and
;; the supporter is picked by asserting context — never on handle id, which is
;; allocated in assertion order and would smuggle arrival order into belief.
;;
;; Each step also reports the **context** its supporter was asserted from, because a
;; caller that depends on a reachability inherits its visibility: a conclusion resting
;; on an edge stated somewhere belongs no higher than a context that can see where it
;; was stated.  So the witness prefers, per edge, the **most general** supporter
;; available — the one every other supporter of that edge sees — since a needlessly
;; specific choice would drag its dependant down with it.  Across *paths* the witness is
;; still the shortest one; a longer route through more general contexts might carry
;; further, and is deliberately not searched for.

  the supporters arrived in.  The key is that name and **nothing else** — never a handle,
  which is allocated in assertion order and would decide where a dependant's conclusion
  lands by which supporter was loaded first (`term-key`, and docs/nmtms.md).

  That name orders the candidates **completely**, and the reason is sentex identity: a
  sentence and a context are what a handle is allocated for, so one edge stated twice from
  one context is one sentex and two supporters of an edge never share a context
  (`subsumption_support_test/an-edge-has-one-supporter-per-context`).  Nothing is left for
  the stable sort to decide, which is what the choice needs — the handle named here enters
  a dependant's justification and reads back out of `why`'s `:because`, so a tie broken by
  arrival would be observable there even where the placement is identical
  (`subsumption_support_test/the-witness-does-not-depend-on-assertion-order`).

  A **single** candidate takes neither the ordering nor the comparison: it is trivially the
  most general, and that is the overwhelming common case.  The short-circuit is not a
  micro-optimization — `more-general-supporter` reads the genlCx closure, whose memo a bulk
  load retires on every context edge it asserts, so paying it per edge per subsuming firing
  cost a fifth of the schema load.

  Walks the same visible adjacency the scoped closure reads do, so it finds a witness for

  general supporter (`edge-supporter`), the choice placement wants.  This is the read the
  `genlCx` visibility walk and every unstrengthened caller take.

  **With `supporter-class`** (a `handle → defeat-class` read) it is a *widest-bottleneck*

  exists.

  `step` maps a node to its outgoing steps `[next [handle ctx] rank hid?]` in content
  order, one per supporter a route may name for that edge.  `rank` is the supporter's
  strength rank, or nil where strength takes no part, and `hid?` is true when an except

  supporters' contexts (`context-floor`) and the set of its hidable supporters.
  Extending a route never makes its label cover more, so the walk drops a partial route
  whose label a route already held at the same node covers, or one a route already found
  at `goal` covers.
  A node therefore holds one partial route per uncovered label, and where every edge is
  stated in contexts one reader sees, that is one route per node.

  The queue orders by rank, then by the specificity of the floor's most specific member,
  then by length, then by the printed terms of the step and the printed floor.  Of two

  (`special/revived-declaration-sweeps`).  A small edge can make a large, already-stored
  extent jointly visible, and the walk that decides whether any of it merges must not
  grow with the extent once it is past the cap.  A sweep cut short is never silent: each
  caller files its own notice naming its trigger.

  **Where a cut can see arrival order, and why it is left there.**  Below the trigger
  level — the down-closure, the context ancestor set, the posting list of one type or
  predicate — nothing is sorted: the enumerations are lazy so a budgeted consumer
  realizes only its prefix, and sorting to choose that prefix forces the whole extent,
  which is the cost the cap was added to refuse.

  That is measured rather than assumed.  Sorting the context ancestor set took
  `retract-context-cycle-scaling` from 0.08 to 0.28 ms/op at 2048 contexts — a 3.4x
  growth against a 2x bound — because a context cycle makes the ancestor set the whole graph.
  The check exists to say a retraction is flat in the graph it is not about, and a sort
  is exactly what stops it being.

  **The residual is stated on each sweep.**  The cap selects a handle-ordered prefix, and
  a merge a sweep fails to reach is not derived by a later settle, so past the cap the
  order-dependence is in whether a merge is derived at all.  It is bounded and reported
  (a `:context-edge-exposure-truncated` or `:genl-edge-revival-truncated` violation per
  cut), and below the cap it is exact.

  **Why 8192 and not 4096.**  The cap bounds a sweep against a *large* extent, and 4096
  sat within 3% of what the shipped ontology plus a 200-fact generated corpus
  (`generate_test/a-generated-kb-derives-cleanly`) enumerated.  A cap a mid-size KB
  reaches by existing truncates a normal sweep rather than refusing an unbounded one.
  8192 restores the headroom."

(defn- separation-frame*
  "Everything a disjointness question about `a` settles before any candidate is named:
  `a`'s supertype closure, the declarations that reach it, and the visibility
  predicates its context imposes.  The closure is read cut to the types a separation can
  reach through (`separable-genls`, `separable-genls-at` scoped), and whole only for the
  sibling arm's chain under a marked parent above `a`.

  What survives the build is only what `a` can possibly be separated *by*: the
  supertypes of `a` that are declared disjoint from something (`:seps`, each with the
  set it is declared disjoint from), and the metatypes some supertype of `a` belongs
  to (`:metas`, each as `[m members members-above-a]`).  Both are usually empty — most
  types are declared disjoint from nothing and belong to no metatype — and when they
  are, no candidate is looked at at all, not even to read its closure.

  Two readers ask it in opposite directions: `disjointness-test` closes over it and
  tests a candidate, `separating-partners` reads the same two rosters to *enumerate*
  the other side.  One prologue, because the failure two copies of it would have is a
  candidate the predicate convicts and the enumeration never reaches.

  A nil, variable, or otherwise unscoped `context` gives visibility predicates that are
  constantly true *and take no key*, so the unscoped path never builds the `#{x y}` a
  visibility lookup would need — the whole reason the pair set is not what disjointness

  This is the enumeration `disjointness-test` is the membership test of, and the two

(defn disjoint?
  "Are types a and b provably disjoint?  True when some supertype of a and some
  *different* supertype of b are separated — by a declared `(disjoint x y)`, by both
  being members of one disjoint metatype, by both being non-genl-related proper
  specializations of one `(sibling_disjoint C)` parent, or by both being parts of one
  `partition` roster.  Every way, disjointness is
  inherited downward through genl (subtypes of disjoint types are disjoint), which
  is what the walk over both up-closures buys.

  The sibling arm is the metatype arm keyed off the genl closure rather than a
  recorded membership set: `(sibling_disjoint C)` separates C's specializations by
  being consulted, and its one added guard skips a separator pair `x`,`y` when one is
  a genl of the other — read **globally**, so a reader that cannot see a `genl` edge
  does not separate a pair the KB knows overlaps.

  The metatype arm is why no clique is stored: `(disjoint_metatype M)` separates
  M's members by being *consulted*, not by materializing a `(disjoint a b)` per
  pair.  Only metatypes still marked are consulted, so unmarking one releases every
  pair it separated in a single step.  Being consulted is also what makes the arm
  *scopable* at all — a materialized clique would have frozen each pair in whatever
  context the expansion ran from.

  The context arity scopes on three levels: the two `genls` closures walk only
  visible edges, a `(disjoint x y)` pair counts only when some supporter's context
  is visible, and the metatype arm asks the same of the mark and of each of the two
  memberships.  Every added visibility probe sits *behind* an existing cheap
  membership guard, so the negative path — the overwhelming majority, since this
  runs on every unary assert — costs what the global read costs over the (smaller)
  scoped closures.

  `context` may be an ancestor set instead: the closures and declarations read are those
  some supporter states in the set, with no belief callback (`genls-asserted-in`), so the
  read does not re-enter the supporter callback.

  Monotone on the visibility of declarations and edges: seeing more of them only adds
  witnesses.  A `siblingDisjointException` is the one read that removes one: the three
  mark arms spare the separated pair it names at a reader that sees it, so a context below
  the exception reads the pair apart and a context above it, or beside it, reads it
  separated.  An unscoped read sees every exception."

  separating declaration (a `(disjoint x y)` pair, a metatype mark plus both
  memberships, a `sibling_disjoint` mark plus the steps down to it, or a `partition` /
  `separating` roster naming both).  All four spellings are here because a caller reads
  emptiness as *not disjoint*, and one left out would make that reading disagree with
  `disjoint?` about one KB.  A reader sees the clash iff it sees every context in *some*
  witness; a supporter with no recorded context imposes nothing and never appears.

  Lazy on every level — paths, separated pairs, and per-ingredient supporter
  choices can all multiply, and a node can have exponentially many ancestor paths
  — so a consumer that finds its witness early never pays for the tail.

  This is `props-over`'s shape and it walks **up** for `props-over`'s reason: the
  constraint refuses tuples rather than licensing them, so a declaration on a super
  binds the sub.  `(functionalInArg parentOf 2)` has to convict two `fatherOf` mothers

  the arity-2 case it generalizes — which the regression half of

  Storage is `arity`'s rather than `:props`': the declaration carries an integer, and a
  `:props` roster is a set of predicates with nowhere to put one.  `::prop-kind` is
  therefore **not** extended — `arity` is not in it either, and the spec is the `:prop`
  storage targets read off the declarations, which a kind derived from `n` has none of.

  store in different places (`props :functional` and the `:functional-in-arg` table) and
  an entry point that asks only the first is closed to the generalized mark while reporting
  itself as free-for-a-KB-that-declares-nothing.  That is not hypothetical: it is what
  `equate-under-edge` did, so a `genl` edge arriving last under `(functionalInArg P 2)`
  merged nothing where the same edge under `(functional P)` merged — the arity-2
  behaviour the generalization is not allowed to move.  See
  `functional-family-marks` for the spelling roster this is the storage half of.

  Two set-emptiness reads and no walk, the `or` short-circuiting on the commoner
  spelling, which is what lets it sit in front of every extent sweep."

  `(Q y x)` under `(inverse P' Q)` is `(P' x y)`, and a `P'` tuple is a `P` tuple by
  subsumption, however it is spelled.  A step relation or a swapped-goal delegate
  reading only `p`'s own partners leaves those edges silently off the graph — a claim
  then answers under the sub-predicate and not under its super, which no reading of
  `genl` admits.
