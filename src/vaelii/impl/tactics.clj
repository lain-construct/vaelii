  "The node engine's search **policy** — one additive estimate whose terms carry signs the
  caller picks, so `vaelii.impl.inference` searches breadth-first, depth-first or best-first
  without a second driver.  The frontier is a priority queue precisely so that changing a
  number is enough; this namespace is that number.

      estimate(node) = Σ literal-cost(Lᵢ)                     what the conjunction costs
                     + size-penalty × |literals|              shorter conjunctions first
                     + depth-sign × depth-weight × Σ dᵢ       rewriting allowance left
                     + tree-sign  × tree-weight  × tree-depth search-tree level

  **The base term is the KB's own cost model, not a second one.**  It is
  `plan/explain`'s per-literal estimate summed — the count-aware trie model with sideways
  information passing that already orders every join in the engine, so a conjunction is
  costed here exactly as `core/query-plan` reports it.  One model, two readers; a node
  ordering that disagreed with the plan it is about to run would be a cost model arguing
  with itself.

  **The signs are the whole personality of the search.**  Σ dᵢ is what a node is still
  *permitted* to rewrite, so a negative depth sign prefers the node with the most room
  left and a positive one the node closest to spending it — a node nearly out of
  allowance is a node nearly ground, hence nearly answerable by facts alone.  The tree
  term is the analogous choice over the search tree rather than the rewriting budget:
  positive is level order, negative is a dive.

  **Ordering is a cost decision and never a semantic one.**  Every tactician here
  returns the same answer set; what differs is when.  `inference_tactics_test`'s
  completeness sweep is the gate that keeps it that way, and the one mode that
  deliberately returns fewer answers (`:first-result?`) says so in its own docstring and
  is excluded from that sweep by name.  The join *inside* a node is ordered by
  `plan/order` alone and never by the strategy, for the same reason: a complete search
  has to visit the same literals whatever order the nodes pop in.

  See docs/inference.md."

  A literal whose only route is an expensive backchain is costed by the index at its own
  fan-out, which for a predicate with no stored facts at all is zero — the most
  expensive literal in the conjunction ranked as the cheapest.  This asks the rules
  instead: unify the goal with each candidate consequent and cost that rule's
  antecedents, recursively.

  `:aggregate` is the choice between two honest readings of several candidate rules.
  `:first` takes the **min** — any one rule suffices, so the cheapest route is what the
  goal costs.  `:all` takes the **sum** — a complete search runs every candidate, so
  they all get paid for.

  Strictly more expensive to compute than a direct estimate, and recursive, which is why
  it is opt-in (`:estimate-backchain?`), bounded by `:depth`, and consulted only for a
  literal that still has rewriting allowance.  `seen` caps it at a repeated goal
