  "The calls that run *up* the engine's layering, gathered in one file.

  Every edge in the engine is a static require the compiler checks:

    kb <- checks <- special <- integrate <- chain <- settle <- vaelii.core

  Three calls run the other way, and the static require graph cannot express any of them.
  Two are **genuine mutual recursion**: the cycle is in the *behaviour*, and no code motion
  removes it — the assert path reaches a mint that asserts (`assert-sentence`), and
  negation-as-failure runs the prover registry back over its own argument (`solve-goal`).
  The third, `retract-sentex`, is the teardown entry point a below-core solver
  (`vaelii.impl.asp.solve-context`) reaches to retract a labeling artifact: the teardown
  orchestration is core-private and has not been extracted below core, so this call runs up
  rather than down for now.  They are collected here so the set can be counted, and so
  `lein lint`'s **E8** can fail a literal `requiring-resolve` anywhere else under `src/` and
  **E19** any target beyond these three.  Each is a `delay` over `requiring-resolve` rather
  than a dynamic var; why is docs/namespaces.md, \"The layering\".

  A namespace that merely sits *above* `vaelii.core` and calls back down to its public API is
  **not** written here — a call that can point downward is made to point downward.  Reading a
  dump (`vaelii.impl.io.import`) recovers through `vaelii.impl.recovery`, the
  `predAllSpecified` audit (`vaelii.impl.predall`) reads through `vaelii.impl.provers`, and the
  `functional_at_instant` audit (`vaelii.impl.fluent`) reads through `vaelii.impl.provers` and
  the node engine `vaelii.impl.inference`; all sit below `vaelii.core`, which requires them.

  `*defer-settle?*` lives here too, because both sides of the assert recursion read it."
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [assert]))

;; ---- the write-path mode flag --------------------------------------------
;; It lives here rather than with the write path because both sides of the recursion read
;; it: `vaelii.core`'s assert decides whether to settle by it, and `skolem` binds it around
;; a mint to say "not now — I am inside the fixpoint you are about to settle".  Down here
;; both can see it without either naming the other.

(def ^:dynamic *defer-settle?*
  "When true, the assert path does **not** `settle` after storing — belief is left
  un-reconciled for the caller to settle once, later.  Three callers bind it:

  - a rule firing minting a skolem NAT mid-fixpoint (`vaelii.impl.skolem`): the nested
    `(termOfUnit K E)` assert is monotonic bookkeeping and the enclosing firing settles
    once when it finishes, so settling per mint would be redundant churn — and worse,
    would relabel belief inside the running chain (docs/skolem.md);
  - a fired conclusion reducing a ground `Quasiquote` to its constant
    (`vaelii.impl.quasiquote/reduce-in-conclusion`), which is the same mint at the same
    moment and defers for the same reason;
  - `with-deferred-settle` / `assert-many`, which run a whole batch of asserts under it
    and settle once at the end, so a bulk load pays one belief reconciliation instead of
    N.  Chaining still runs per assert (only the `settle` is deferred), so the final
    settle sees the same stored state a per-assert settle would have, and order
    independence guarantees the same beliefs.

  Retraction settles eagerly regardless — reviving a defeated default is not part of an
  assert batch."

;; ==== Genuine mutual recursion ============================================

;; `assert-sentence` runs the full assertion path.  Three namespaces call it from inside
;; the chaining fixpoint `vaelii.core/assert` itself started: `vaelii.impl.nat` (a reified
;; NAT stores its `(termOfUnit K E)` map and its materialized types), `vaelii.impl.skolem`
;; (a firing mints its witness) and `vaelii.impl.quasiquote` (declaring the four marks
;; quasiquotation runs on).  Storing is a *whole* assert — naming, the definitional checks,
;; the index, chaining, settle — so the write path runs chaining, and chaining calls back
;; here to mint a constant.  The cycle is in the behaviour, and no arrangement of the code
;; removes it (docs/skolem.md).
