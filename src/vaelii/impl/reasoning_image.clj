(ns vaelii.impl.reasoning-image
  "A **reasoning image**: the whole reasoning state of a KB
  (`vaelii.impl.types.reasoning`), written as three files and installed into an empty KB in
  place of a recover.  Two places hold one: a `:disk-snapshot` KB's own directory, under
  `<dir>/reasoning/`, and an export dump, under `<dump>/reasoning/` (`dir-name`).

  `:belief? true` is still what the export and import option is called, because that option
  decides whether the **labels** are carried, and a dump written with `:belief? false`
  holds records and no image at all.

  ## What is in it

  - `network.bin` — the dense network (`dense/write-image`): every node, justification
    column, label, defeat-class, block, forced set and supersession;
  - `state.nippy` — the taxonomy's relations and caches, less the slots the live KB
    owns (`taxonomy-side-slots`), and the KB atoms recovery fills or the closing settle
    leaves (`state-atoms`);
  - `manifest.edn` — the stamp, written last, so a directory with no manifest holds no
    image.

  ## The stamp

  The two layout numbers, a records fingerprint, the source identity's digest, and the
  policies that move belief: `config/assertive-arg-types?`, and the forced-monotonic
  roster the stored declarations give (`declared-roster`).  The
  records fingerprint differs by place, because each place is checked against something
  different.  A disk image carries the record store's `reasoning-fingerprint`, read off the
  slots without decoding a record.  A dump's image carries content fingerprints of the
  sentexes and the justifications the dump streams (`fingerprint/accumulator`), which an
  import recomputes while it lands them.

  ## When one is installed

  `install-from!` installs an image when every one of these holds, and otherwise leaves the
  KB untouched for the full recover:

  - the KB is on the dense network, and its network holds no node;
  - its provers and its solver are the defaults (`refusal`): a registered prover or
    evaluatable runs code the source identity does not cover;
  - the manifest's stamp equals the KB's (`decision`).

  Both sections are read in full before anything moves into the KB, so a torn or
  truncated section costs the recover and never leaves a half-installed network.
  `install!` is the disk image's case: a `:disk-snapshot` KB (`applies?`) against its own
  directory.

  ## When one is written

  `save!` writes a `:disk-snapshot` KB's image after a full recover, and `register-close!`
  arranges a refresh when the directory closes if the records moved since the image was
  written.  The records stamp is read before and after the sections are written, and an
  image whose records moved during the write is abandoned.  A close-time write is also
  skipped when the source identity at close differs from the one belief was derived under
  at open: a REPL can reload engine code mid-session, and an image carries the digest of
  the source that derived its belief, never the digest of source loaded afterwards.
  `vaelii.impl.io.export` writes a dump's image through `write-sections!`.  Neither place
  takes an image of a KB whose network does not cover its records (`writable?`).

  ## What an installed image equals

  The records stay the only source of truth.  An image is installed whole, against the
  exact records, source and policies it was written under, or discarded whole; nothing
  reconciles an image against records that moved.  So a KB that installs an image is the
  KB that wrote it, field for field, less the journals and the discovery memo's journal
  position, which an image is written without, and the memo's `:mark`, which names a
  point in the writer's touched window and which the install drops.  The install
  restarts the candidate index's journal.  An image written after a
  recover is that recover.  An image written by a KB built assert by assert carries that
  KB's labels, which equal a recover's because belief is order independent, and that KB's
  derivation depths, which a recover rebuilds from the records
  instead of reading ([docs/defenses.md](docs/defenses.md), \"A reasoning image is
  installed whole or not at all\")."
