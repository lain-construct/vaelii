  "Quasiquotation — the metalinguistic constructor (mention-opacity: docs/argtypes.md).

  `(Quasiquote T)` builds the syntactic term `T` with each `(Unquote v)` hole replaced by
  `v`, and names the result *as syntax* — a mention.  `(Quasiquote (isa (Unquote ?x) Dog))`
  fired with `?x`=Fido constructs the term for `(isa Fido Dog)`.

  The model is **skolemization**, not the `evaluate` prover: a `Quasiquote` is a
  term-constructor sitting in argument position (`(believes Tom (Quasiquote …))`), built
  deterministically from a firing's bindings and reified when the conclusion is placed.  Reduction of a
  ground `(Quasiquote T)` strips its `Unquote` holes to the expression `E`, then reifies
  `(Quote E)` — `Quote` being a reifiable **quoting** function, so `E` reifies to an opaque
  `nat/` constant that mention-opacity holds apart from its referents' merges.  Determinism
  is content-addressed for free: `E` *is* the content, so `nat/reify-or-mint-nat` dedups two
  firings on one binding to one constant (no rule digest / frontier is needed, unlike a
  skolem witness, which is anonymous).

  `Quasiquote` is an `unreifiable_function`, so an *open* template — the one that lives in a
  rule consequent until the antecedent binds its `Unquote` holes — stays structural and is
  never minted; range restriction (`rules/check-range-restricted`) already refuses a hole no
  antecedent binds, so an open template never reaches storage.  It is a `quoting_function`
  too, so while it waits in the rule its `Unquote`-marked spellings are held opaque to an
  identity merge exactly as a `Quote` payload is.

  Turned on by declaration, like `reifiable_function` turns the reify pass on: a KB that has
  not declared `(quoting_function Quasiquote)` pays one taxonomy-prop read per firing/assert
  and the reducer is a no-op.  And like reification, it is **declared before use**: opacity is
  applied when a mention is reified and again in the equality congruence, each gated on the
  mark being present then, so `ensure-quasiquote-functions` (or the four marks) must precede
  the constructions it governs and any identity merge over the referents inside them.  A reify
  or merge processed while the mark is absent — before it is declared, or after it is retracted
  — is not held opaque and folds the mention onto its referent's class."

  into the form the stored content is in, so a lookup can meet it: **reify** ground
  NATs to their existing constants, then **rewrite** terms to their equality-class
  representatives and schematic normal forms (`kb/rewrite-goal`).

  This is the parity every read path holds to, and the backward chainers need it as
  much as the rest: without the rewrite step a goal naming a merged spelling — or one
  an oriented equation would normalize — is answered by `sentexes-matching`/`ask` but
  silently missed by `prove`/`query`, and the same knowledge answers path-dependently.
  It is the **top** goal that is normalized, exactly as `sentexes-matching`/`ask`
  normalize theirs; stored facts are already in normal form (migration), so subgoals a
  rule expansion generates need no further rewriting — the same reliance `ask` makes.
  `rewrite-goal` exempts
  `different` and a positive equation, whose arguments must stay un-rewritten to read class
  membership (`res/goal-held-as-spelled?`), and the
  congruence walk under it exempts a **mention** — a `quoting_function`'s arguments, and the
  proposition a `modal_predicate` attributes to its agent, which is normalized against the
  *agent's* partition where the projection reads it rather than against the asker's
  (docs/belief.md).  Both exemptions hold on the stored side too, so the goal and the
  sentex still meet at one form.

  Rewritten by the merges `context` sees, since that is where the goal is asked.  It lives
  here, beside `maybe-reduce`, because it composes the two read-time reductions
  (`maybe-reduce` and `nat/maybe-reify-for-read`) with the equality rewrite, and both
  `vaelii.core`'s read entry points and `vaelii.impl.predall`'s audit prepare a goal the
