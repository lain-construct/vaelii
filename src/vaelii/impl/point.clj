  "The point algebra over time **instants** — a relation algebra over the generic
  constraint network in `vaelii.impl.qcn`, and the smallest one there is.  Three base
  relations, jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint, so exactly one holds of any two
  instants:

    :before   t(a) < t(b)
    :equal    t(a) = t(b)
    :after    t(a) > t(b)

  `vaelii.impl.interval` is about stretches of time, which have extent and can therefore
  meet, overlap and nest; this is about the moments themselves, where the only question is
  which came first.  The two meet at `vaelii.impl.stp`, which relates an interval to its
  two endpoint instants and puts numbers on the gaps between them.

  **The same algebra appears twice in this tree.**  `vaelii.impl.projection` builds a
  nine-relation algebra out of two independent one-dimensional projections — the cardinal
  directions of `vaelii.impl.orientation` and the relative frame of `vaelii.impl.relative`
  are both that shape — and each projection is exactly these three relations under the
  spellings `:lt` / `:eq` / `:gt`.  The table is duplicated rather than shared: there the
  three relations are a position on an axis and an implementation detail of the algebras
  built over them, here they are an order in time with their own vocabulary, and neither
  namespace should have to read the other's keywords to say what it means.  Nine identical
  entries are cheaper than that coupling, and either copy is checkable against the
  definitions on its own.

  Instants are **stored as ordinary sentexes** — the three named binary predicates
  (`instantBefore`, `instantAfter`, `instantEqual`) plus three derived ones
  (`instantNotBefore`, `instantNotAfter`, `instantNotEqual`) that each name a *disjunction*
  of them.  An instant named by a symbol is an ordinary individual.

  The calculus reads every asserted instant relation visible from a context into a
  qualitative constraint network — `{[i j] → #{possible base relations}}`, an unrecorded
  pair meaning \"unknown\", i.e. all three — and `qcn/path-consistent` tightens it to a
  fixpoint.  The prover then answers a goal `(P i j)` by **entailment**: it holds iff every
  relation still possible between i and j satisfies P, `possible ⊆ denotation(P)`.  So
  `(instantBefore A B)` and `(instantBefore B C)` entail `(instantBefore A C)`, and the
  weaker `(instantNotAfter A C)` with it.

  For three relations path consistency is not merely sound but **complete**: the point
  algebra's full disjunctive form is tractable, and a network of it that survives the pass
  has a model.  So an emptied constraint here means genuine unsatisfiability, which is what
  makes a cycle of strict `instantBefore` facts a reportable contradiction rather than a
  suspicion.

  **A node is an instant or a point of a thing.**  Besides instants named by a symbol,
  the network takes the six point terms of `vaelii.impl.timepoint` — `(StartFn X)`,
  `(EarliestEndFn X)` … — and calendar moments, and reads the order those terms fix
  among themselves as a second reader: one thing's start before its end, its bounds
  around them, calendar moments by their fields.  So a story's own order, a period's
  uncertain boundaries and a dated claim are one network, and a cycle through any of them
  is the same reported inconsistency as a cycle of stated facts.  `IncludesInstantProver`
  reads a thing against a moment off it: yes, no, or unknown where the moment falls
  inside a range a bound leaves open.

  The vocabulary ships in `kb/upper/CxTime.txt` beside the interval relations.  The
  prover is **opt-in** on top of it: register it with `vaelii.core/add-prover`, and until
  then a KB stores and retrieves instant relations as ordinary facts without paying for the
  network."

  entailed by more networks than a base one, and the base predicates are the singletons.

  The three derived predicates are each the complement of one base relation, and over a
  jointly-exhaustive triple a complement *is* a negation — so the names are literal.
  `instantNotAfter` is ≤ and `instantNotBefore` is ≥, which is what a temporal ordering
