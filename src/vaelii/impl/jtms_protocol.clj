 vaelii.impl.jtms-protocol
  "The representation boundary of the truth-maintenance system: the `Tms` protocol
  alone, with no implementation.

  It lives in its own namespace, apart from `vaelii.impl.jtms` (the reference
  network) and `vaelii.impl.dense-jtms` (the dense one), for two reasons.  Both
  implementations depend on it, and the reference depends on nothing of the dense one, so
  the boundary is the one thing they share; the dense network also calls two helpers of
  the reference namespace (`graph-just`, `dissoc-all`).  And it is large — forty-odd methods, each documented — which
  makes the generated protocol map big enough that re-evaluating the form (as
  cloverage does, form by form, to instrument a namespace) overflows the JVM's
  64 KB per-method bytecode limit; isolated here, the protocol is loaded but not
  instrumented while the whole of `vaelii.impl.jtms` still is (scripts/coverage.sh).

  A held namespace (`vaelii.impl.types.prover` states what that means): it defines the `Tms` protocol and requires no vaelii namespace, so the development browser's reloader never re-evaluates it, and an edit to it takes a restart.")

(defprotocol Tms
  "What a truth-maintenance network must answer, independent of how it stores the
  graph.  Two implementations ship: `RefTms` in `vaelii.impl.jtms` — an atom over one
  persistent map, the reference — and `vaelii.impl.dense-jtms`, which holds the same
  graph in bitmaps and primitive-keyed maps.  Selected per KB (`open-kb`'s `:tms` opt),
  dense by default since 0.9.0, and proven to answer identically by `jtms_dense_oracle_test`.

  The boundary is at the *representation*, not at the algorithm: both implementations
  run the same least-fixpoint relabel over the same affected region, because that is
  the semantics, not an implementation detail.  What differs is where a node's
  premise flag, depth and adjacency live.

  ## What the network computes

  One function, and every method below either supplies an argument to it, reads a
  result of it, or edits its domain:

      label(graph, attributes, blocked) -> (in, classes)
      believed                           = in - superseded

  `graph` is the nodes and justifications.  `attributes` are the per-element strengths
  the class fixpoint reads, and the three **forced** sets the forced-monotonic roster
  writes (docs/nmtms.md, \"The forced-monotonic roster\"): `:mono`, premises whose class is
  `:monotonic` whatever strength they carry; `:out`, datums never IN; and `:void`,
  justifications that support nothing.  The caller decides each membership from the
  stored content and writes it with the element, as it writes a strength.  `blocked` and
  `superseded` are two sets the **caller** computes and replaces whole every settle — the
  network is pure and holds no KB, so it can run neither query that decides them.  `in`
  and `classes` are what a relabel writes.  No contradiction forces a datum OUT: a
  contradiction is decided at each reader, above this boundary, so the network holds
  support labels only, and an `:out` member is the one datum the fixpoint never adds.

  The two overrides enter belief at two different points, and a method that confuses
  them is wrong in a way no label comparison catches:

  | override | enters at | moves |
  |---|---|---|
  | `blocked` | inside `valid?`, so a blocked justification supports nothing | `in` |
  | `superseded` | subtracted at the read, after the fixpoint | nothing — the datum stays in `in` so its rewritten twin keeps its justification |

  `vaelii.impl.jtms` states each at length under *the state*.

  ## The seven roles

  `roles` below assigns every method exactly one, and `jtms_protocol_test` fails on a
  method in none or in two.  The roles are a division of **what a method touches**, not
  of what it may be implemented without: every mutation relabels, so every role's
  mutators write the output role's state, and no partition of these methods is closed
  under writes.

  | role | what it holds | what supplies it |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:graph` | nodes, justifications, depth, adjacency | `-ensure-node`, the two `-add-*`, `-retract`, `-sweep`, `-drop-justification` |
  | `:attribute` | a premise's and a justification's strength, and the forced sets | written with the element, and by `-restrength-informant` and `-set-forced` |
  | `:blocked` | the blocked justification-id set | the caller's exception query |
  | `:superseded` | the `datum -> reason` map | the caller's equality closure |
  | `:output` | `in`, `classes` | every relabel |
  | `:window` | the touched sets | every relabel |
  | `:hold` | the labels a settle has moved, as they were when it began | the settle |

  **A third place belief is decided is not on this protocol.**  A reader's verdict and a
  visibility `except` are applied per reading context by `vaelii.impl.resolution`, over
  `vaelii.impl.jtms/grounded-in-region` — which is built on the reads here and is
  therefore not a method at all, so both representations answer it without implementing
  anything.  The network's labels do not move for either, and `-believed?` answers the
  same before and after one.

  ## What an implementation owes

  Four obligations.  Miss one and a network is *wrong*, not slow — belief is the last
  thing in the engine that may drift silently, since a bad label does not throw, it
  just answers a query differently.  Each names the gate that holds it, because an
  obligation with no gate is a comment.

  1. **The same fixpoint over the same region.**  Binds `:output`, and through it
     `:blocked`, the fixpoint's override argument.  A datum is believed when it is a
     premise or has a valid justification (all antecedents believed); the label is
     recomputed over the forward consequence closure of
     whatever changed, with the rest held fixed as boundary.  That is the *semantics*
     of belief here (docs/nmtms.md), not a strategy an implementation may improve on:
     the region fixpoint is equal to the global one because a least fixpoint with the
     boundary fixed is unique, and uniqueness is also the whole of why locality costs
     no order independence.  An implementation may move where the graph lives; it may
     not move what is believed.  Gate: `jtms_dense_oracle_test`, which compares the
     entire `-snapshot` after **every** step of a randomized operation stream — not a
     sampled read, because a divergence in a class or a block is invisible to
     `-believed?` until a later operation reads it.

  2. **A mutation is atomic to a concurrent reader.**  Binds every role.  A reader
     sees the state wholly
     before or wholly after a relabel, never half of one — the single-writer contract
     owes the incidental reader that much (a web browser over a REPL's KB,
     docs/storage.md).  *How* is not the obligation and the two differ: the reference
     by compare-and-set on its state atom, the dense network by taking its
     `StampedLock` for writing.  Gate: `jtms_atomicity_test`, whose atomicity half runs
     against both networks for exactly this reason.  **While a hold is open**
     (`-hold`), a thread other than its owner reads the `:output`, `:blocked` and
     `:superseded` roles as they stood when the hold began, so a settle's
     run of relabels reaches such a reader as one step when the hold closes.  The reference keeps
     its state map from that moment; the dense network records each label the first
     relabel after it moves, which costs the region that relabel walks.  Gate:
     `kb_concurrency_test`, on both networks.

  3. **The flips are inside the published window, and the window inside the region.**
     Binds `:window`.  `-touched` is not diagnostics: `preview`, the consequence report and the change
     feed all read it instead of diffing the believed set, which would be O(KB) per
     write (docs/preview.md, docs/feed.md).  A window that missed a flip serves a stale
     report; one that outran its own region would say the operation was not local after
     all.  The containment is deliberately one-way — the window is a **superset** of
     the flip set (defenses.md) — so this obligation is containment and never equality.
     Gate: the oracle test checks both containments on both networks after every
     step, and `jtms_locality_test` measures the published window across graph sizes
     on both — a region widened back to the whole graph answers identically, so a
     comparison of labels alone would pass it.

  4. **No store, by construction.**  Binds every role, and its second half binds
     `:attribute` in particular.  Every method here takes the network plus integers
     and plain values.  Nothing crossing the boundary can carry a record store, an index or a KB,
     and no implementation may acquire one.  Two things rest on that and neither is
     optional.  A node holds **no reference to the sentex it labels** — the network is
     always resident, so a strong reference would pin every record in RAM and defeat a
     paging backend entirely (measured: the nodes reached 50% of the record store).
     And `-premise-strength`, which the class fixpoint reads per in-region node, is a
     *memory* read on every representation, which is what makes locality a claim about all of them rather than
     about the one whose reads happen to be free — on a disk store that read would be a
     lock and a slot decode, on a server store a round trip, per in-region node per
     worklist pop.  Gate: the structure of this protocol, plus both implementations' `ns`
     forms, which name no store.  A store-backed network would break the structural
     guarantee and inherit an obligation nothing here gates: it would owe a
     read-counting one of its own.

  One claim is deliberately **not** on that list, because nothing at this boundary can hold
  it: the cost of the in-region work itself.  Obligation 3 says a small region was asked
  for and obligation 4 says nothing was paid per boundary node, and neither says the
  small region was *cheap* — a structure whose every write rebuilds a whole container
  satisfies both and still grows with the KB, at a scale no unit test reaches
  (docs/defenses.md argues it under *Locality is a claim about every representation*).
  It is held by `lein bench-jtms` and by review.  It is written down here anyway,
  because an implementation that is never told about a claim cannot be held to it.

  Every method is named with a leading `-`; the plain names (`in?`, `add-premise`, …)
  are the public functions in `vaelii.impl.jtms`, which dispatch here.  Callers use those."
