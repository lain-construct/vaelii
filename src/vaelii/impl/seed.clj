  "Ontology KB files: declarative content held as **plain text on the classpath**
  rather than as code.

  A KB file is a list of ordinary vaelii sentences — one s-expression each, with
  `;;` line comments and blank lines allowed — named for the context its sentences
  assert into, and grouped **term-centrically**: every sentence about a vocabulary
  term sits together, and the terms run in natural sort order.  A rule is just a
  sentence carrying an `implies` / `set/*Rule` / `exceptWhen` wrapper.

  **The format itself — reader and writer both — is `vaelii.impl.io.text`**, which is
  where its one non-sentence spelling lives (`(set/monotonic S)`, the known-true class)
  and what `vaelii.core/export-text!` writes.  What is here is the *classpath* side: the
  shallow tree under `resources/kb/` and how a layer's files are discovered in it.

  The files live under `resources/kb/`, in a shallow tree that mirrors the context
  spindle:

      kb/CxCore.txt        the vocabulary head (see vaelii.impl.core-context)
      kb/upper/<C>.txt          definitional layers, between Core and Universe
      kb/middle/<C>.txt         theory layers, between Universe and Well

  The file *name* is the context; the sub-directory is the layer.  Only the layer a
  caller names is discovered, so a sibling directory under `kb/` that names no layer here
  is not loaded: `kb/koinii/` is one, an application's own context files, which that
  application loads for itself.  What stays in
  **code** (vaelii.impl.starter) is the *order* the files load in and the handful of
  genuinely computed assertions.  Sentences read with `clojure.edn`, so a KB file is
  data and can never run code."

  classpath shape holds them: a filesystem tree (repl / lein / test) is listed as a
  directory, and a packaged jar is listed by its own entries — anchored on
  `kb/CxCore.txt` when the jar carries no directory entry for `kb/<dir>` to
  resolve.  Any other protocol is refused rather than answered nil: nil here starts
  a KB with the upper and middle layers silently absent, the exact failure
  `read-sentences` exists to refuse one file at a time."
