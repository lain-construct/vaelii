  "Build the in-memory JTMS and taxonomy for the persistent stores — the store-to-belief
  `recover`, which installs a reasoning image (`vaelii.impl.reasoning-image`) or rebuilds from
  the records and writes one.

  It sits just below `vaelii.core`, above `settle`, so the two callers that recover a store
  both reach it downward and neither reaches up: `vaelii.core` exposes it as the public
  `recover`, and `vaelii.impl.io.import` recovers the records a dump just landed
  (docs/namespaces.md, \"The layering\").  `recover` orchestrates the layers below —
  `rebuild-tms` over the JTMS, `special/rebuild-taxonomy`, the roster rebuilds in `kb`, and
  the closing `settle` — so the top of that orchestration lives here rather than inside any
  one of them.  The contract `recover` holds to is on `vaelii.core/recover`; docs/taxonomy.md
  and docs/nmtms.md carry the mechanism."

  Recovery cannot read supersession back — it is derived from the closure, and recovery
  lands with the map empty (a fresh network holds none), exactly as it lands unblocked.
  Left that way, *both* spellings of every merged fact would be believed, which is a
  worse state than the merge simply being forgotten.  So the displaced sentexes are
  nominated once here and `supersession-map` filters them down to the ones whose twin
  is genuinely stored.

  Two sources, matching the two ways `rewrite-term` displaces a sentence: a **symbol
  merge** (walk the equality classes for every member's sentexes) and a **schematic
  rewrite** (a stored sentex the rule's LHS head reaches whose normal form differs).
  `supersession-map` re-derives the actual displacement — `rewrite-term` normalizes both
  — so this only has to name candidates.

  It names them by **class membership alone**, without asking whether the global
  election displaces the term.  Displacement is the *reader's*, and the global answer is
  not a superset of the scoped ones: a term can be the head of its whole class and still
  be retired inside a context whose visible edges elect someone else, when the
  `rewriteOf` that made it preferred is one that context cannot see.  Filtering here
  on the global read would drop exactly those, and recovery would come back believing
  both spellings."

(defn- rebuild-tms
  "Rebuild the network from the store: a node per stored sentex, a premise per rostered
  handle, and a justification per stored justification.  Belief is the composition of the
  region relabels the adds run, not a separate whole-graph pass.

  **No whole-graph relabel closes this.**  `add-justification` relabels its consequence's
  affected region as it lands, and a region relabel over the affected closure is equal to a
  global one (`jtms/relabel-region*`); premises are marked before any justification, so each
  add already reads its antecedents' final belief.  The region relabels therefore compose to
  the fixpoint a whole-graph `jtms/relabel` computes, and a global pass on top of them only
  recomputes what is already settled — measured at a third of `rebuild-tms` on a disk corpus
  (`scale-100m.md`, the recover decomposition's step 4).

  **And no reset of blocking or supersession either — recovery lands unblocked because it
  starts fresh.**  A network opened for recovery is empty, blocked and superseded sets
  included, so the region relabels above already label unblocked.  Neither is stored
  (docs/nmtms.md), so a rebuild cannot read either back; it need not clear them because the
  two are re-derived **wholesale** rather than merged — `recheck-every-exception` queues
  every exception-bearing rule and the settle *replaces* the blocked set (`jtms/set-blocked`),
  and `refresh-supersessions` replaces the supersession map — so not even a `core/reindex`
  over a live network can carry a stale one past the settle.

  **A justification naming a sentex this store does not hold is left out**, and this is
  the one path that can meet one.  Everywhere else a justification is built by a firing,
  whose antecedents are records the caller has in hand; here they are numbers off a
  store, and a store can hold a justification whose records are gone — `delete-sentex!`
  is on the protocol, and another dialect's loader is under no obligation to be
  consistent.  `add-justification` does not refuse one: the reference representation
  grows a phantom node for the missing datum and the dense one is not specified there
  (`vaelii.impl.dense-jtms`), and a justification *concluding* the phantom makes it IN —
  so the KB comes back believing a handle it cannot show anyone, and everything derived
  from it.  Skipped and counted instead, which is the policy `io.import` takes at the
  other end of the same store.

  A rule-handle informant is checked with the antecedents (`jtms/rests-on`): the network
  treats it as an implicit antecedent and lists the justification under its node, so a
  justification whose rule is gone is left out as one whose fact is gone would be."

  A `:disk-snapshot` KB whose reasoning image still describes its records, its source and

  other KB, and that one whenever the image is declined, recovers from the records
  (`recover-from-records`) and then writes an image for the next open
  (`reasoning-image/save!`, a no-op for a KB that takes none).  Both paths register the
  close-time refresh (`reasoning-image/register-close!`).

  Under `kb/*background-belief?*`, which `open-kb` binds for `:recover? :background`, an
  image declined only for its engine source is installed anyway, and `start-rebuild!`
