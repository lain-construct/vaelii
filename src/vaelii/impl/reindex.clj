  "Rebuild the index store wholesale from the record store.

  Everything the index holds — the trie, the secondary roots, the rule index, the
  exception re-check index, the inverted term index — is *derived* from the
  stored sentexes, and the mint family from the stored justifications, so the repair
  for a damaged or stale index is mechanical: clear it and re-derive every entry.  Three situations need it:

  * a crash between the record write and the index pipeline (`assert` spans both
    stores; each side is a single pipeline, but the boundary between them remains)
    — the orphaned record is unfindable, and re-asserting its sentence
    would mint a *second* handle for the same canonical form;
  * an index whose key shapes are not this build's (`kv/index-layout-version`): a
    lookup finds no key and answers nothing, which is fail-safe and undiagnosable, so
    a persistent KB needs this rebuild;
  * any suspicion that counts and extents have drifted: a rebuild is cheaper
    than an audit.

  Run `core/recover` afterwards: it rebuilds the TMS and taxonomy from the
  stores, and parts of that rebuild (`rebuild-taxonomy` reads the predicate extents)
  read the very index this restores.

  Named bare, like `recover`: the `!` convention marks destruction of stored
  *knowledge*, and this destroys only derived state and recreates it from the
  records, which stay untouched."
