  "The **operation log**: each public write a KB takes, recorded as the call that made it.
  A frame holds the operation's name, its arguments, and the inputs the call reads that
  its arguments do not carry — the clock `:created` is stamped from, the creator, and the
  dynamic bindings that change what a write stores.  `vaelii.core` names the operations
  and their classes in its `write-ops` table, routes each through `run-op`, and installs
  the table as the dispatch `replay!` runs frames through.

  ## One frame per outermost write

  A write the engine makes inside another write is part of the enclosing call: the
  asserts inside `assert-many`, the assert a skolem mint makes, the retraction
  `retract!` makes of an orphaned NAT.  `*in-op?*` is true for the extent of a recorded
  operation, and `run-op` appends no frame while it is; the nested write runs under the
  bindings the enclosing operation made.

  ## Classes

  - `:replay` — the call is recorded, and its arguments and inputs determine what it
    stores.
  - `:seal` — `import!`, `clear!`, `recover`, `reindex`, `load-text!`: the call's effect
    depends on something no frame carries (a directory's contents, the records as a
    whole).  It marks the log unusable and requests a seal, which runs when it returns.
  - `:config` — `set-solver`, `add-prover`, `add-evaluatable`, `add-reasoner`: the call
    registers code, which no frame can carry, so it marks the log unusable.

  ## Unusable

  A log is **unusable** from the first write it cannot reproduce until a seal starts it
  again (`rotate!`).  `mark-unusable!` appends an `{:unusable reason}` frame, so the mark
  outlives the process.  A `:seal` or `:config` operation marks it, and so do arguments
  nippy cannot freeze, a write a change-feed listener makes (a listener runs part-way
  through another operation's settle, where `vaelii.core/dispatch-feed!` binds
  `*listener?*`), and a record write outside every operation (`LoggedRecords`).

  ## The logged record store

  `attach` wraps a KB's record store in `LoggedRecords`, with a **watermark**: one above
  every handle the store held when the log's generation began.  The page cache can write
  a record to disk before it writes the frame describing the operation that stored it,
  so a crash can leave a record no durable frame accounts for.  A replay finds every such
  record at a handle at or above its own allocations, except a write to a handle below
  the watermark — a deletion, a premise mark, a provenance change of a record the
  generation began with.  So before the first such write in an operation,
  `LoggedRecords` fsyncs the operation's frame.  An operation that only adds records
  pays no fsync.

  In **replay** mode (`attach-replaying`) the store allocates handles from the watermark
  and checks each write against the record already stored at its handle: an equal record
  is left as it is, a missing one is written, and a different one throws with
  `::diverged` in its ex-data.

  ## Generations and replay

  The file's first frame is a header naming the log's **generation**.  `rotate!` starts
  a generation: it truncates the file to a new header and clears the unusable mark.
  `replay!` runs each operation frame through the installed dispatch with `*replaying?*`
  bound, so `run-op` appends nothing and binds the frame's inputs, and with the change
  feed off, since listeners belong to the process that made the writes.  An operation
  that refused when it was made refuses again, and replay goes on to the next frame.
  `vaelii.impl.seal` decides which generation a restore replays and what a seal writes.

  ## Durability

  One file, `<dir>/oplog/ops.log`, of length-prefixed nippy frames in
  `vaelii.impl.disk.files`' format.  An open truncates a torn trailing frame, as the
  record logs' opens do.  The log's `:fsync` mode decides when a frame reaches the disk:
  `:each` fsyncs each operation's frame before the operation runs, and `:tick` leaves it
  to the durability daemon's tick.  The daemon closes the log on shutdown.

  A failed append, fsync or truncation latches the log's fault (`files/latch-fault!`),
  as it does a record store's: every later operation is refused with `:store-unusable`
  before it runs, so no write lands that the log does not describe."
