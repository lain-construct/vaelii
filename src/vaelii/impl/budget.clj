  "Resource-bounded / anytime realization of an answer stream.

  The engine's query paths are **lazy** — `ask`, `query`, and the level stack
  all yield one solution at a time, paying per result consumed.  Resource-bounding
  is therefore the *consumer-side* discipline of realizing that stream under a
  bound and reporting whether it ran dry or was cut short — and resumption falls
  out of laziness for free, because the unrealized tail **is** the continuation.

  A **budget** is a map of optional bounds (any subset; nil / {} means unbounded):

    :max-ms       wall-clock milliseconds — a soft deadline, checked *between*
                  yielded results (between DFS steps and node expansions in
                  `prove-within`), and inside one only by a walk that reads
                  `*deadline*` (the argument-preservation prover's claim walk);
                  every other single pull or step runs to its end
    :max-results  stop after this many solutions
    :max-cost     a qualitative prover-cost ceiling — a tier keyword (see
                  `vaelii.impl.provers/cost-tiers`).  Honored by `ask-within`,
                  which drops provers above the tier before the stream is built;
                  ignored *here*, since it selects *which* work runs, not how much
                  of a stream to realize.
    :max-depth    transformation (rule-expansion) depth — honored by `prove-within`
    :max-term-growth
                  how many levels of compound nesting a subgoal may add over what its
                  own derivation path has already met (`res/default-max-term-growth`,
                  8) — the DFS prover's other termination guard, honored by
                  `prove-within` through `prove-bounds`

  A key outside those five is refused (`:unknown-option`, `check-budget!`): every
  bound is optional, so a misspelt one is not missing — the run is simply unbounded,
  in silence.

  A **partial result** — the anytime contract returned by `collect` / `from-batch`
  / `resume`:

    :results      the solutions realized in *this* step (a vector)
    :status       :complete  the source ran dry — the answer is exhaustive
                  :timeout   :max-ms elapsed with work remaining
                  :capped    :max-results reached with work remaining
    :count        (count :results)
    :elapsed-ms   wall-clock spent in this step
    :resume       nil when :complete; otherwise a 1-arg fn (budget -> partial
                  result) that continues exactly where this step stopped

  `:results` are per-step, **not cumulative**: concatenate across steps for the
  whole answer.  The resume continuation captures an in-memory lazy tail (or, for
  `prove-within`, the DFS goal stack), so resumption is **in-process only** — it
  does not survive a restart, and holding one pins its captured state in the heap
  (see the single-writer contract in docs/storage.md)."

  realizes the whole stream, which on an infinite source never returns, and is in any case
  the opposite of what was asked.  And a bound holding a value it cannot mean — a string
  `:max-ms`, a zero `:max-results` — reaches arithmetic and throws bare, where every
  sibling refusal is typed; `check-values!` catches it here (`opts/bound-domains`).
  (A `:max-cost` value outside the tiers is checked separately, `:unknown-option` at
  `vaelii.impl.provers/cost-capped-provers`, which `ask-capped` reads the registry
  through — it is not a numeric bound, so it has no row in `bound-domains`.)

  `opt-keys` defaults to the union `budget-keys` — what `resume`, `collect` and the two
  drivers hold a budget to, since a `resume` continues either entry point.  `ask-within`
  and `prove-within` pass their own narrower roster and subject, so a caller who names
  `:max-depth` at `ask-within` is told it is not a bound `ask` reads."

  "Realize the lazy seq `xs` under `budget`, returning the partial-result contract.

  Both bounds are checked *before* pulling the next element, so `:max-results` n pulls
  the source n times and a passed deadline stops without over-reading; the element
  under the cursor is never lost — it stays the head of the captured tail, so
  `resume` re-pulls it.  A `nil` / `{}` budget realizes the whole seq (`:complete`).

  `restart`, a 0-arg fn building `xs` afresh, lets a walk inside one pull stop at the
  deadline too: the pulls run with `*deadline*` bound, and a pull a walk interrupts
  (`check-deadline!`) answers `:timeout`.  An interrupted lazy seq cannot be re-pulled (a
  `LazySeq` whose nested realization threw reads as empty afterwards), so the
  continuation rebuilds the stream with `restart`, drops the answers already returned,
  and runs its first pull without the deadline.  Each resume therefore gets past the
  interrupted walk, and a resume loop under a fixed budget terminates.

  `rest`, not `next`: `next` realizes one element *ahead* to decide whether a tail
  exists, so a cap of n would pull n+1 from the source.  `rest` defers that, and the
  cap check sits above the `empty?` that would force it — so an unbounded source is
  bounded without reading past the cap.

  **How many elements that realizes is the source's business, not this loop's.**  n pulls
  realize exactly n elements of an **unchunked** seq, which is what every seq the engine
  hands here is — a `lazy-seq`/`cons` chain out of the solvers and the index, pinned by
  `laziness_test/a-capped-ask-pays-for-the-cap-and-not-for-a-chunk`.  A *chunked* source —
  anything built by `map`/`filter` over a vector or a range — realizes its whole 32-element
  chunk on the first pull whatever the cap says, and no cap check above it can prevent
  that.  So the promise a caller may rely on is the one about the source: n pulls, and
  the tail resumable from where they stopped."
