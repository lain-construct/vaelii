  "Scenario extraction over a qualitative constraint network — turning \"here is what is
  still possible\" into \"here is one way it could be\".

  Path consistency leaves a *set* of relations on every pair.  That is the right answer to
  what is entailed, and the wrong shape for a caller that wants a concrete arrangement: a
  drawing of the regions, a timeline of the intervals, an example to show someone.  A
  **scenario** is one consistent choice of a single base relation for *every* pair — a
  singleton-valued network that survives path consistency, and so an arrangement nothing
  believed rules out.

  The search is ordinary backtracking, with the two refinements that make it bearable:
  **fewest possibilities first**, so the most constrained pair is decided while it is still
  cheap to be wrong about it, and **re-tighten after every choice**, so a decision that
  empties some *other* pair is caught at once rather than at the leaf.

  **Calculus-generic.**  It takes a `vaelii.impl.qcn-kb` calculus, so it works for RCC-8
  topology, cardinal direction, Allen's intervals, the point algebra and anything added
  later, with no line of it aware of which.  Everything it needs is on `qcn` and `qcn-kb`'s
  public surface: the network, its nodes, a constraint, and the pass.

  **Deterministic.**  The same believed facts yield the same scenario every time, and two
  KBs built by asserting the same facts in a different order yield the same scenario as each
  other.  Both orderings the search makes — which pair to decide next, and which relation to
  try first — break their ties on **content**: nodes and relations are ordered by how they
  are written, never by a handle id or by map iteration order.  Handles are allocated in
  assertion order, so keying on one would smuggle that order into the answer, which is what
  the whole engine forbids.

  **The count is exponential**, so nothing here enumerates eagerly.  `scenarios` is a lazy
  sequence — one scenario costs one path down the search tree, not the tree — and takes a
  `:limit` for a caller that would rather say how many it wants than remember to bound the
  sequence itself.  See docs/scenario.md."
