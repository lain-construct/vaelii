  "Pure ASPIF text emitter. No vaelii deps, no I/O.

   ASPIF is the Potassco Answer Set Programming Intermediate Format, the
   ground-program protocol between gringo and clasp.

   **This emits what the engine's programs are built from**, and no more:
   the rule line (type 1) as facts, choice atoms, normal rules and
   integrity constraints, weight-body rules and constraints (the
   cardinality bound a `asp/atMost` / `asp/atLeast` translates to), plus
   minimize (2) and output (4).

   The rest of the format — projection (3), externals (5), assumptions
   (6), heuristics (7), acyclicity edges (8), and type 1's disjunctive
   and multi-head choice heads — has no encoder here. An encoder nobody
   executes is not coverage of a format; it is unverified text generation
   claiming to be. What the engine needs, it emits and its tests
   exercise, and nothing else is written here.

   Wire format of what is emitted (line-oriented, space-separated):
     Line 1: `asp 1 0 0`
     Rule:     1 <head_type> <head_size> <head...> <body_type> <body_size> <lits...>
                 head_type = 0 disjunctive | 1 choice
                 body_type = 0 normal (list of signed literals)
                        or = 1 weight  (a cardinality/weight body)
                 body literal: +atom for positive, -atom for default-negated
     Weight body: 1 <lower_bound> <n> <lit_1> <w_1> ... <lit_n> <w_n>
                 satisfied when the summed weight of the satisfied literals is
                 at least <lower_bound>.  A cardinality constraint is the unit-weight
                 case: `k+1 <= #count{ ... }` is a weight body of bound k+1 over
                 weight-1 literals.  Emitted headless (an integrity constraint that
                 excludes any model reaching the bound) or with a head (an atom that
                 holds when the bound is reached, for a soft/minimized violation).
     Minimize: 2 <priority> <n> <lit_1> <w_1> ... <lit_n> <w_n>
     Output:   4 <str_len> <str> <n_conditions> <atoms...>
     End:      0

   Atom ids are positive integers; 0 is the terminator and must not
   appear as an atom. String lengths in show statements count bytes
   (equal to character count for ASCII); non-ASCII names need UTF-8
   byte counting which we do not currently handle.

   The public API has two halves:

     (1) Statement constructors (`fact`, `choice`, `rule`, `constraint`,
         `minimize`, `show`) that return plain data maps. Data form is
         inspectable, easy to assemble programmatically, and trivial to
         unit-test.

     (2) `render` turns a sequence of statements into the full ASPIF
         text with header and terminator."

   Forbids models in which the summed weight of the satisfied body literals

   pairs (a literal is a positive atom-id or negative for default negation).

   A cardinality bound is the unit-weight case: at-most-`k` over atoms `M`
   forbids `k+1` of them holding — bound `k+1` over each `[m 1]`; at-least-`k`
   forbids `|M|-k+1` of them absent — bound `|M|-k+1` over each `[-m 1]`."
