  "The in-process ASP backend: a JNA binding to libclingo, with `vaelii.impl.asp.clasp/solve`'s
   modes and return shape.  `solve` injects a translated program's `:stmts` through the
   `clingo_backend_*` accessors (`backend-load!`); `classify-both` loads the ASPIF text once
   over a temp file and runs both enumerations on one control.  The search flags are
   `clasp/search-args`, and the time limit is a cancel at the deadline (`drain-models`).
   Every native return is checked, and every solve handle and control is freed in a
   `finally`.  See docs/asp.md, \"Getting a solver\" and \"The time limit\"."
