  "What a forward rule over an **aggregate** antecedent costs at load time.

  The cost is structural and worth naming rather than discovering: a count is
  recomputed, never cached, so a rule that joins on one has to be re-joined whenever a
  counted fact arrives.  Not merely re-checked — **re-joined**, over the whole extent,
  because an aggregate binds a *value* and a moved count is a different conclusion
  rather than the same one relabelled (docs/aggregate.md, \"Maintenance\").  So loading
  *n* facts on a counted predicate pays *n* joins of *n* groupings each.

    no rule             the floor: the same facts with nothing counting them
    rule first          the real cost — the rule is standing as the facts arrive
    deferred chaining   the same, asserted `{:chain? false}` with one `forward-chain`
                        at the end — which does **not** help, and the reason it does
                        not is the point of the table
    one edit            the whole load as a single `edit` batch: one settle, so one
                        drain of the re-check queue
    rule last           the facts first, then the rule: one join over a finished
                        extent, so the reductions are done exactly once

  The shape is a chain of *n* nodes under `(transitive ancestorOf)`, which is what makes
  every node's ancestor set a different size and every count real work.
