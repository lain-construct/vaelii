  "One corpus, one workload, N index layouts — the bake-off a layout proposal is judged
  by.

  The precedent is the columnar trie, which was chosen by a bake-off that ran *before*
  the build (`vaelii.bench.densetrie`, docs/density.md).  A plausible design and a good
  one differed by an order of magnitude and only a measurement separated them.  This
  generalizes that from \"which representation\" to \"which shape\": hold the corpus and
  the question set fixed, vary the layout, and report what each costs.

  ## The gate: a layout may change cost and may not change answers

  Mechanical, not reviewed.  Every layout answers the identical probe set, and each
  probe's answer is fingerprinted as `[handle-count (hash handle-set)]` — content, not
  order, since two layouts may return one set in two orders.  A layout whose fingerprint
  differs from the reference's is reported as **WRONG** and its timings mean nothing.

  A projection comparison has a hole that this shape of harness inherits in a worse
  form, and `index_dump_test` already names it: **a layout that quietly falls back to a
  coarser access path answers identically and is merely slower.**  Read as a duration
  that is a fair loss; read as a path it is a misconfiguration.  So the access-path
  report is printed **first**, before any number that could be mistaken for a verdict,
  and a layout whose path histogram diverges from the reference's is called out by name.
  `vaelii.impl.profile`'s `:goals` tally is where it comes from — keyed by shape *and*
  by the path the shape chose, with `test/vaelii/profile_test.clj` pinning each of the
  nine labels.

  ## What is measured, and what is measured elsewhere

  * **Retrieval time per goal shape**, per layout, as a ratio against the reference.
  * **Build time, resident bytes, and bytes per sentex** — jol retained heap of the
    index store, which docs/density.md trusts under contention where it declines to
    trust wall-clock.
  * **Estimator quality as a q-error curve**, `max(est/actual, actual/est)` per join
    depth, computed by `vaelii.bench.plan` and not rebuilt here.  The reading that
    matters is whether q is **flat in the depth** — flat means the estimates compose,
    growing means no better ordering over them would rescue the plan — rather than
    whether it is small.  §4.4 of the paper is why a layout that retrieves faster and
    estimates worse can be a net loss no retrieval microbenchmark shows.
  * **Index reads by family**, so a layout that answers from a different family says so.

  Two quantities are deliberately absent because they exist:

  * **Write cost per assert, per family** is `test/vaelii/assert_cost_test.clj`, which
    pins the exact operation counts, and `lein bench-profile`, which reads them out over
    a whole corpus.  Deriving a second write number here would be a second answer to a
    settled question.
  * **Allocations per lookup** is `vaelii.bench.alloc`.  The seam is deliberate: that
    namespace drives the same arms by reaching `#'vaelii.bench.index/layouts` and
    `#'vaelii.bench.index/open-layout!`, so the two harnesses compare the same layouts
    over the same corpora rather than two spellings of them.

  ## The columnar arm reads as a KB that never touches its trie

  This matters more here than anywhere else in the repo, so it is handled explicitly
  rather than noted.  **Only the `:goals` tally is index-independent** (docs/profile.md):
  it is taken above the index, in `resolution`.  `:reads`, `:fan`, `:writes` and
  `:retracts` are `KvIndexStore`'s seams, and the columnar store's trie is native — its
  `lookup` and its three count probes report no read and no fan, and its writes bypass
  `KvIndexStore` entirely.

  So comparing a columnar layout against a flat-map one on `:reads` would report a
  fabricated result: the columnar arm would look like an index nobody reads.  Every
  layout carries a `:kv-seams?` flag, the read table prints **`n/a  (native trie — no
  KvIndexStore seam)`** rather than `0` for a layout that has none, and the access-path
  and answer-set reports — which are index-independent — are the ones that span all of
  them.  A zero and an absence are different readings and are printed differently.

  ## Methodology, taken from `vaelii.bench.perf`

  Four of that gate's decisions were each learned from a *comfortable pass* that turned
  out to be a measurement error, and three of them transfer directly:

  * **Warm every layout to the same amount.**  Warming proportionally to the work a
    layout happens to do hands the slow one a JVM that has JIT-compiled the code being
    timed while the fast one is still climbing to it.  Here the analogue is the inner
    repetition count: it is calibrated **once, on the reference layout**, and every
    layout then runs that same count.
  * **Summarize the tail rather than the run**, over a fixed window at every layout, so
    two answers cover windows of equal width.  The summary is the **median** rather than
    perf.clj's mean, and the difference is that perf.clj re-runs a check that exceeded
    its bound and keeps the better run.  Nothing here has a bound to exceed, so one GC
    pause in the *reference's* window would scale a whole row — which it did, once, by
    3x — and a median over the same window is that defence with no verdict to hang it on.
  * **Report `noise` below the floor rather than a green light.**  A ratio between two
    readings that are mostly timer jitter means nothing, so a timed unit is padded with
    inner repetitions until it clears the floor by two orders of magnitude, and a unit
    that still cannot is printed as `noise` and not as a result.

  The fourth — pick a small size at which the measured thing has barely started — is
  about a two-size growth ratio, and this harness has no second size: it compares
  layouts at one corpus.  What it inherits instead is the same warning in the other
  direction: **a corpus too small for the layouts to differ reports that they do not**,
  which is a fact about the corpus.  The starter is 1,500-odd sentexes and is a
  smoke test of the harness; `generated` and a converted corpus are where a difference
  can exist.

  A fifth decision is this harness's own and follows from the same argument.  **The
  timings are interleaved by group, not by layout**: measuring every group of layout A
  before any group of layout B puts tens of seconds between the two readings a ratio is
  taken over, so drift over the run — heap growth as each layout's KB stays resident, a
  background process, thermal throttling — lands on the layout axis and reads as a layout
  difference.  Group by group, the compared readings are seconds apart.

  **Build wall-clock is the least trustworthy number here** and is labelled so in its own
  table.  Two discarded starter loads precede the first measured build, which removes
  most of the JIT skew, but the layouts are built in order and each one's KB stays
  resident for the workload, so the last build runs against a fuller heap than the first.
  The tell is `deep-terms`: it writes a strictly larger key set than `kv` and cannot be
  faster to build, so a run where it reads faster is a run whose build column is
  measuring the JVM.

  The literal cache is bound **off** for the whole measured workload.  `matches-visible`
  caches its answers per KB keyed by the literal and the three retrieval switches
  (`vaelii.impl.literal-cache`), so with it on the second pass over a probe set measures
  a hash lookup and every layout ties.

  ## What this harness cannot see

  In the spirit of `vaelii.bench.perf`'s own list, because a harness whose limits are
  not written down reads as covering more than it does.

  * **Anything on the write path.**  A layout change that moves cost from the read path
    to the write path is invisible to a read-only workload, and every workload here is
    read-only.  Build time is the only write reading, and it is one number for a whole
    corpus rather than a per-family count: `assert_cost_test` is the instrument for that.
  * **What the context cone costs.**  Every probe is asked at `?ctx`, so the
    `genlContext` up-closure is never walked.  A layout question about the context level
    is not answered by these numbers.
  * **Allocations, objects and bytes on the walk.**  Retrieval time is wall-clock, and
    wall-clock is the reading docs/density.md declines to trust under contention, so the
    read path is held here to the weaker standard.  `vaelii.bench.alloc` is the
    structural counterpart.
  * **A family this workload does not read.**  The term index and the term roster are
    read by `terms` / `find-terms` / `find-sentexes` and by no reasoning at all, so a
    layout that moves them — `:deep-terms` moves exactly that — shows up here as bytes
    and as nothing else.  `lein bench-profile`'s interactive arm is the one that reads
    them.
  * **The difference between two layouts that both estimate correctly.**  The q-error
    arm runs on `vaelii.bench.plan`'s 1:1 chain, where a correct estimator scores exactly
    1.00 at every depth, so the arm fails a layout whose counts diverge and cannot rank
    one against another.
  * **A cost that is not the index, which is most of what is timed.**  Unification,
    belief filtering, the taxonomy closures, the record fetch and the frontier the walk
    rebuilds at every level are all inside every reading here, and every one of them is
    *common to both arms of every ratio*.  A ratio divides a shared cost out, so a layout
    that is 5% of the total cannot move the total by more than 5%, and a row that reads
    1.05x may be a layout that is twice as expensive at the part it owns.

    This is `perf.clj`'s \"a baseline large enough to already carry the cost being
    measured\" arriving as a *denominator* rather than as a small size, and it is the
    same trap in a second place.  `vaelii.bench.alloc` hit it head-on measuring the same
    two layouts by allocation: bytes per lookup separated the flat map and the columnar
    trie by 1.2 to 1.5x, and the marginal bytes per *extra frontier node* — the quantity
    with the shared cost removed — separated them by more.  Every number in this file is
    a total of that kind.  Read a ratio here as a floor on the layout's contribution, and
    read the counts, the paths and the retained bytes as the quantities that are not
    diluted.
  * **The four `KvIndexStore` tallies on a layout that is not one**, which is the
    columnar caveat above.

  Run:

      lein bench-index [corpus] [workload] [args …]

      corpus    starter | generated [facts] [rules] | corpus <dir> [profile]
      workload  shapes (default) | heads | local | all

        shapes  every binding pattern over sampled facts of the busiest predicates,
                asked at level 4 — `res/matches-visible`, which is the set-algebra
                matcher and 81 to 100 percent of the retrieval traffic every corpus
                profiled so far.  Synthetic on purpose: its question is what a shape
                costs, not which shapes arrive.
        heads   each rule's own consequent, asked at level 4.  A rule's consequent is
                the question the rule exists to answer, so the set is a workload the KB
                declared for itself.
        local   `shapes` at level 2 — `res/raw-match`, the `candidate-handles` matcher,
                which is the minority path and the one `lein bench-profile`'s balanced
                probe drives.
        all     the three.

  A corpus run wants a heap, and `:bench` pins `-Xmx6g`.  An environment `JVM_OPTS` is
  placed before the project's own options and loses to it silently, so edit the vector on
  the way past — `with-profile` first, `update-in` second:

      lein with-profile +bench,+with-foreign update-in :jvm-opts conj '\"-Xmx32g\"' -- \\
        run -m vaelii.bench.index corpus shapes <dir>"
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
