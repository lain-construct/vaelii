  "What a **mapped index snapshot** takes off the heap, and what it does not.

  Residency is the lever here: keep the working set in RAM and page the cold tail.  `vaelii.impl.disk.index-snapshot` implements it for the columnar
  index — the CSR skeleton, the roots' key column and the token dictionary are read into
  heap, the leaf handles and the roots' handle run are `mmap`ed.  This measures the split
  rather than asserting it, and it is the gate the design is judged by: *loading more
  facts over the same vocabulary must not grow resident heap in proportion*.

  The corpus is deliberately **vocabulary-fixed**: the same individuals, types and
  predicates at every N, so the only thing that grows is the number of facts over them.
  That is the shape the question is about — a KB whose vocabulary has settled and whose
  extent has not.  Two sizes, and the answer is the *growth* between them rather than
  either figure, so the number means the same on any machine.

  RAM is jol retained heap of the index store — structural, so contention-immune.  A
  mapped section reads as ~0 here **because it is not on the heap at all**: a
  `MappedByteBuffer` is an address and a length, and its pages live in the OS page cache.
  That is the measurement, not a gap in it; the bytes are reported separately from the
  files they came from.

  Run: `lein bench-residency [facts] [multiple] [individuals]`
       (default 25000 facts, ×4, over 400 individuals)."
