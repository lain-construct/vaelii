  "Qualitative-constraint-network scaling — the one axis the QSR subsystem ships without a
  number for, and the one that decides whether it is a story-scale toy or a KB-scale
  reasoner.

  `qcn/path-consistent` is an **arc queue** (PC-2): one full sweep of every ordered triple
  `(i j k)`, then revisits of only the triples a narrowing could have affected.
  `qcn/path-consistent-naive` is the reference it is proven equal to — the same sweep,
  repeated wholesale while anything narrows. Both are measured here, side by side, because
  what the queue buys is entirely a question of how much of the network a first pass
  moves:

    - **triples** — n(n-1)(n-2), the structural cost of one full sweep. Exact, trusted,
      and the floor for either implementation.
    - **pass wall-clock**, queue and naive — the fixpoint over a network the shape a KB
      actually produces. Indicative rather than trusted (JIT, GC, contention), but the
      *ratio* between the two, and between node counts, survives noise.
    - **KB read** — `qcn-kb/network`, one belief-filtered read per predicate of the
      calculus per polarity. This is what the per-query memo exists to avoid repeating,
      and it is linear in stored facts where the pass is cubic in nodes, so which one
      dominates is a function of how dense the network is.

  Two shapes, because they tighten very differently:

    - **containment tree** (RCC-8 `nonTangentialProperPart`, branching 3) — every pair in
      a root-to-leaf path composes to a definite relation, so the network fills in and the
      fixpoint does real work. The realistic case.
    - **interval chain** (Allen `before`) — a total order, which composes to a definite
      relation for every one of the n² pairs. The dense worst case a KB can reach without
      being inconsistent.

  Run: `lein bench-qcn [max-nodes]`  (default 160)."
