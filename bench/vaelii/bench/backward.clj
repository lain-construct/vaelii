  "Backward-chain rule-path scaling — the axis that matters for this corpus (99% backward
  rules), which RETE does not touch.

  A backward goal on predicate P is answered by expanding the rules that could conclude P:
  `res/concluding-rule-handles` = `specs(P)` ∩ `rules-by-consequent(P)`, an **indexed**
  intersection over the rule index (`:rule-index :consequent`).  So the per-goal candidate set is bounded by
  *how many rules conclude P* — not by the total rule count — provided that lookup really is
  indexed and never scans.  This bench verifies that and sizes it:

    - candidate-set size (`rules-by-consequent`) for a hot vs rare consequent predicate, as
      the rule count N grows — a hot consequent's candidate set grows (it is the cost driver
      of a backward goal on it); a rare one stays flat, and neither is O(N)-by-scan.
    - the `:rule-index` posting RAM under the current boxed sets vs a dense `int[]` (the same
      tiering Phase 1 found for fact postings applies to rule postings).

  Structural sizes (candidate counts, posting RAM) are trusted; any wall-clock is untrusted
  under contention.  Rules are indexed via `p/index-rule` directly (the reference load path,
  as in bench/memory.clj), so this measures the rule INDEX, not assert-rule's checks.

  Run: `lein bench-backward [max-rules]`  (default 200000)."
